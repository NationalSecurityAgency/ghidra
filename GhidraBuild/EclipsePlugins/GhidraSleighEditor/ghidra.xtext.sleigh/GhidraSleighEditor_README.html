<h1>GhidraSleighEditor README</h1>
<p>GhidraSleighEditor makes developing and modifying Ghidra Sleigh processor modules much more enjoyable by providing a modern
day context sensitive editor with syntax highlighting, navigation, context sensitive error notation, quick fixes, and more.  The
editor is built with the excellent XTEXT DSL framework within Eclipse.
</p>
<p>The information provided in this document is effective as of Ghidra Sleigh Editor 1.0.0 and is subject to

<h2><a name="Install"></a>Installing GhidraSleighEditor</h2>
<p>GhidraSleighEditor is installed manually into Eclipse and should be installed by anyone interested in working with
processor module sleigh specifications.  The Sleigh Editor must be manually installed in Eclipse.  In the future the extension
may be installed automatically along with the GhidraDev Eclipse plugin when setting up Eclipse for Ghidra scripting and plugin development.</p>

<h2><a name="Upgrade"></a>Upgrading</h2>
<p> GhidraSleighEditor can be upgraded the same way it was initially installed.</p>
<p>(<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>)</p>

<h2><a name="Features"></a>Sleigh Editor Features</h2>
<p>The Ghidra Sleigh Editor provides a variety of features one would expect in any modern IDE to make viewing, modifying, debugging,
and creating Sleigh processor specifications as painless as possible.
Once installed, any .sinc or .slaspec file that is edited will be brought up in the sleigh editor.</p>
<p>The editor provides the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="Hilite"></a>Syntax Highlighting</li>
  <ul>
	<p>Keywords, Tokens, Sub-constructor names, Comments, Instruction Formats, Strings, Variables, and more can be colorized to make
	the sliegh specification more readable.  In the <b>Window &#8594; Preferences &#8594; Sleigh</b> preferences panel, the color and font style can be changed
	for any sleigh file tokens.</p>
  </ul>
  
  <li><a name="Validate"></a>Validation</li>
  <ul>
    <p>The structure of a sleigh file while fairly simple can lend itself to errors when using a straight text editor.  The editor understands
    the syntax and all constructs of a sleigh file.  Instead of waiting for the sleigh compiler to produce an error, many but not all syntax
    errors can be caught and displayed with a red error marker.</p>
    <p>The editor validates the definition of variables including locals.
    Though legal in the sleigh compiler, it has been found that not declaring local variables leads to
    errors that are not be caught by the sleigh compiler.  For example, assigning to a variable 'ro' when the actual register name is 'r0' may go
    unnoticed.  All local variables must be defined with with the 'local' keyword or with an initial ':size'.</p>
    <p>Warnings on duplicate names of tokens is marked in yellow.  Complex matching patterns such as <i>'!='&nbsp&nbsp'&lt'&nbsp&nbsp'&gt'</i> are warnings as well.  Using
    comparison matching operators can cause the generated .sla file to be much larger than necessary.  Comparison matching should really never be used on any
    tokens that are bigger than a few bits as the number of match cases generated will be large.  Their use is unavoidable in some cases.<p>
    <p>There are some artificial enforcements in the editor that, while valid sleigh syntax, cause the syntax to be unparsable.  Because the sleigh
    Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a context sensitive grammer, as well as using define-like pre-processing expansion, the editor only allows define
    <b>$()</b> variables at certain locations where a single token would reside.  The most common flagged error is embedding a connecting '&' in a define and then
    using it an a match pattern:
    <ul>
    <p><b>:MOV ax, bx is t1=1 $(BadDefine) {}</b> is not allowed, and instead should be <b>:MOV ax, bx is t1=1 & $(GoodDefine) {}</b>.</p>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
  <li><a name="QuickFix"></a>QuickFix</li>
  <ul>
    <p>Some simple syntax errors can be fixed quickly with QuickFix suggestions. Pressing Crtl-1 on an error will bring up available quick-fixes.</p>
    <li>Undefined local variable - insert 'local' or the ':size" form if the size can be detected.</li>
    <li>Undefined user pcodeop - can insert a user pcodeop definition for an unknown identifier</li>
    <li>Undefined macro - can insert a macro definition for an unknown identifier</li>
    <li>Add token field definition - for an unknown token in the match pattern</li>
  </ul>
  <p>More quick-fixes may be added in the future.  Please note quickfixes can be slow on large files such as the AARCH64.</p>
  
  <li><a name="Hover"></a>Hover</li>
  	<ul>
  		<p>There are many constructs in a sleigh file that, when hovered over, will display additional information.  This is especially useful for tokens to get their
  			size without having to navigate to the token field definition.  More hovers will be added.<p>
  		<li>Sub-Constructors will display all the defined sub-constructors with the same name.</li>
  		<li>Token field definitions will display their size, and if attached, the set of registers.</li>
  		<li>Registers display their size.</li>
  		<li>Numeric values will display in Hex, Binary, and Decimal.</li>
  		<li>$(Defines) display all the possible defines for the name, since the actual define used can't be known.</li> 
  	</ul>
  	
   <li><a name="Navigate"></a>Navigation</li>
   <p>If you have edited a sleigh processor specification in a regular text editor, you will appreciate the forward and backward navigation supported on
   various variable name use and their associated definition.  Navigation is supported on sub-constructor names, field token names, registers, macros names, local variables, define names, and user
   define pcodeop's.</p>
   <p>Navigate by pressing <b>&ltF3&gt</b> on a variable, using the forward/backward navigation arrows, or my favorite the &lt-* that will navigate
   back to the last edit location.<p>
   
   <li><a name="References"></a>Find References</li>
   <p>Instead of keyword searching, the editor provides a find all uses of a variable.  Each found use is listed in a search window with the text of the line where it is used displayed.
   Each found location can also be navigated to by double clicking on the found reference.</p>
   <p>Use the editor popup menu <b>Find References</b> action.</p>
   
   <li><a name="Rename"></a>Renaming</li>
   <p>The name of variables can be very important, and instead of doing a search and replace on a string, the editor can refactor a name and change all other uses of that name.  The name
   is even changed in other .sinc and .slaspec files.<p>
   <p>Use the editor popup menu <b>Rename Element</b> action.</p>
   
   <li><a name="Format"></a>Code Formating</li>
   <p>Sleigh files can get large and messy during development.  Instead of paying much attention to format, or trying to format by hand you can use the Source Format action.
   Common constructs are lined up, for example the token definitions will find the longest token and line up all other tokens and their definition.  All sub-constructors of the
   same name will be lined up on the 'is' keyword, the match pattern, and the semantic definitions.  All constructors 'is' keywords will be generally lined up based on the longest
   print peice for each constructor.  Statements will also be indented consistently.  Multi-line attach definitions will have each entry lined up.
   Formatting can be restricted to a selection of lines to stop formatting from entirely re-formatting carefully formatted files.
   Additional formatting may be added in the future, and the formatter may become more configurable in the future.<p>
   <p>Use the editor popup menu <b>Source &#8594; Format</b> action.</p>
