    <h1>XML Exporter for IDA version 9</h1>
    <p>
      The 7XX versions of the XML Exporter, Importer, and Loader can only be used
      with IDA version 9.0 and greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      <filename>xml_exporter.py</filename> is a plugin to export an IDA database as an XML file.
      It must be placed in the IDA plugins folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <filename>xml_loader.py</filename> is an IDA loader to build a new database using an XML file.
      It loads the .bytes file and builds the IDA database using the contents of
      the XML file. NOTE: Currently, the loader does not support importing memory
      overlays or Harvard architectures (e.g., 8051).
      It must be placed in the IDA loaders folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <filename>xml_importer.py</filename> is a plugin to add data from an XML file to an existing
      database. It will NOT load any binary data from the bytes file. It will add
      symbols, comments, code, data, functions, etc. for addresses that currently
      exist in the database.
      It must be placed in the IDA plugins folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <filename>idaxml.py</filename> module is a require import for the xml_exporter, xml_importer,
      and xml_loader.
      It must be placed in the IDA python folder.
