	This file is a "mix-in" gradle script that individual gradle projects should include if they
	have java code and want javadocs generated for that project
	
	A gradle project can add javadoc support by including the following to its build.gradle file:
		apply from: "$rootProject.projectDir/gradle/javadoc.gradle"
 *****************************************************************************************/

rootProject.createJavadocs {
	source sourceSets.main.allJava
}

rootProject.createJsondocs {
	source sourceSets.main.allJava
}

rootProject.createPythonTypeStubs {
	source sourceSets.main.allJava
}
