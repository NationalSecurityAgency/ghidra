# Licensing Intent

The intent is that this software and documentation ("Project") should be treated as if it is licensed under the license associated with the Project ("License") in the LICENSE file.
However, because we are part of the United States (U.S.) Federal Government, it is not that simple.

this is generally understood to mean that these portions of the Project are placed in the public domain.

In countries where copyright protection is available (which does not include the U.S.), contributions made by U.S. Federal Government employees are released under the License.
Merged contributions from private contributors are released under the License.

Most portions of the Project are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 ("Apache 2.0") unless indicated otherwise.
Some modules incorporate code available under other licenses.
These modules contain human- and machine-readable lists of the governing license(s).
Contributions to such modules must be made available, by the contributor, under the applicable license(s).
