	    <P>The nested code layout use the 
	    <A name="help/topics/DecompilePlugin/Decompiler.htm">Decompiler</A> to arrange the 
	    code blocks of a function in a way that mimics the nesting of the source code as seen
	    in the decompiled function.   As an example, any code block that must pass through an 
	    <code>if</code> statement will be nested below and to the right of the code block that
	    contains the conditional check.   The nested code block is <B>dominated</B> by the block
	    containing the conditional check--code flow can only reach the nested block by passing
	    through the block above it.   Also, code blocks that represent a default code flow 
	    will be aligned to the left and below other code blocks in the function.   This layout 
	    allows the user to quickly see the dominating relationships between code blocks.
	    </P>
	    <P>The edges leaving a code block are labeled with the type of high-level conditional 
	    statement (e.g., <code>if</code>, <code>if/else</code>, etc) used to determine code flow.
	    </P>
	    <P>By default, edges are routed such that they are grouped together such that any edges
	    returning to a shared code block will overlap.  This reduces visual clutter at the 
	    expense of being able to visually follow individual edges to their vertices.  Another 
	    consequence of this routing is that sometimes edges will travel behind unrelated 
	    vertices, again, making it difficult to visually follow these edges.  The edge 
	    routing can be changed via the options below.
	    </P>

		      <P>The <B>Route Edges Around Vertices</B> option triggers this layout to route 
		      edges around any vertex that would otherwise touch that edge.  (See above for 
		      notes on how edges are routed for this layout.)

		      <P>The <B>Use Dim Return Edges</B> option makes default code block return flow edges 
		      lighter than conditional edges.  This makes it easier for users to scan the
		      graph and ignore return flows.
