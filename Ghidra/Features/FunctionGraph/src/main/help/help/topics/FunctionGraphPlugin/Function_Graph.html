      blocks, both for editing and arrangement.</P>

      <P>The graph rendered in the Primary View may represent an undefined function, such as a

      <P>The Satellite View provides an overview of the graph. From this view you may also perform
      basic adjustment of the overall graph location. In addition to the complete graph, the
      satellite view contains a <B>lens</B> (the white rectangle) that indicates how much of the

      <P>When you single left mouse click in the satellite view the graph is centered around the

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Each vertex in the displayed graph represents a code block within the graphed function.
      The term <B>block</B> is used synonymously with the term vertex. The block display consists
      of a header and a code listing. The fields contained in the listing are a subset of the
      available fields. You may change the fields displayed from the <A href=
      "#Function_Graph_Action_Format">Edit Code Block Fields</A> action.</P>

      <P>The header contains the name of the block, as defined by the label at that location, or
      that address if no label exists. The header also contains buttons that allow you to perform
      some common operations on the block.</P>

      <P>As long as you are within the <A href="#Interaction_Threshold">interaction threshold</A>,
      you may interact with the block's listing just as you would with Ghidra's primary <A href=
      "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm">Listing</A>.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The following actions are available from the primary view.</P>

        <H3>Selecting Blocks</H3>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Left-clicking a block will select that block. To select multiple blocks, hold down the
        <B><TT>Ctrl</TT></B> key (or the equivalent for your OS) while clicking. To deselect a
        block, hold the <TT>Ctrl</TT> key while clicking the block. To clear all selected blocks,
        click in an empty area of the primary view. When selected, a block is adorned with a
        halo.</P>        

        <P>You may also select multiple blocks in one action by holding the <TT>Ctrl</TT> key while
        performing a drag operation. Press the <TT>Ctrl</TT> key and start the drag in an empty
        area of the primary view (not over a code block). This will create a bounding rectangle on
        the screen that will select any blocks contained therein when the action is finished.</P>

        <H3>Navigating Blocks</H3>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If you double-click a block header, then the <A href="#Zoom">Zoom Level</A> of the
        Primary View will change. If the block is not at full zoom (1:1), then the zoom level will
        be changed to full zoom. Otherwise, the zoom level will be changed to fully zoomed out. If
        you are zoomed past the <A href="#Interaction_Threshold">interaction threshold</A>, then
        you can double-click anywhere in the block to trigger a full zoom.</P>

        <P>Assuming you are <B>not</B> zoomed past the interaction threshold, then double-clicking
        a field inside the block's listing will perform a navigation <A href=
        "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm#Navigation">as determined by that
        listing</A>. If you <B>are</B> zoomed past the interaction threshold, then double-clicking

		<BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>You can hover over a block to get descriptive information. Depending upon the <A href=

        the interaction threshold, the hover action will trigger a popup window showing a preview

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>This group color feature allows you to easily color large numbers of vertices after

          <P>The Function Graph will automatically color your group vertex, depending on the color
          state of the vertices being grouped:</P>

          <UL>
            <LI>If none, or some but not all, of the vertices being grouped have a user-defined
            color, then the group vertex will be made the default color (which you can change from
            the options).</LI>

            <LI>If all of the vertices being grouped have a user-defined color, but that color is
            not the same, then the group vertex will be made the default color.</LI>

            <LI>If all of the vertices being grouped have <B>the same</B> user-defined color, then
            the new group vertex <B>will be made the color of the vertices</B>.</LI>

        The default setting for automatic relayout is <B>Vertex Grouping Changes Only</B>. This

      <P>At <B>full zoom</B>, or <B>block level zoom</B>, each block is rendered at its natural
      size, which is the same scale as Ghidra's primary <A href=
      "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm">Listing</A>. From that point, which is a 1:1
      zoom level, you can zoom out in order to fit more of the graph into the display.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>To change the zoom you may use the mouse scroll wheel while holding the
        <TT><B>Control</B></TT> key (<TT><B>Command</B></TT> key on the Mac). This works whether
        the mouse is over the primary viewer or the satellite viewer. Also, you may use the context
        popup menu from the primary viewer in order to quickly zoom to the block level (1:1) or to
        the window level (zoomed out far enough to fit the entire graph in the window). These
        actions are <B>Zoom to Vertex</B> and <B>Zoom to Window</B>, respectively.</P>

        <P><IMG src="help/shared/note.png" alt="Note" border="0"> To have the scroll wheel zoom
        without holding the <TT><B>Control</B></TT> key, you can disable the <B>Scroll Wheel

        <H3>Vertex Quick Zoom</H3>

        <P>If you double-click a block header, then the <A href="#Zoom">Zoom Level</A> of the
        Primary View will change. If the block is not at full zoom (1:1), then the zoom level will
        be changed to full zoom. Otherwise, the zoom level will be changed to fully zoomed out. If
        you are zoomed past the <A href="#Interaction_Threshold">interaction threshold</A>, then
        you can double-click anywhere in the block to trigger a full zoom.</P>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>While zooming out (away from the blocks) you will eventually reach a point where you can
      no longer interact with the listing inside of the block. The blocks provide a subtle visual
      indication when they are zoomed past this level, in the form of a drop-shadow. The image
      below shows this drop-shadow. The block on the left is not past the interaction threshold,
      but the block on the right is, and thus has a drop-shadow. This example is for illustrative
      purposes only and during normal usage all blocks will share the save zoom level. So, if one
      block is zoomed past the interaction threshold, all other blocks will be as well.</P>

      </TABLE>
      
      <p>
      Interaction with blocks that are past the interaction threshold is simplified; for
      example, when scaled past the interaction threshold, dragging in the listing area of a block
      will drag the block, instead of making a selection in the listing, as would happen when not
      scaled past the interaction threshold.

      <P>While zooming out (away from the blocks) you will eventually reach a point where contents
      each block will not be painted. Instead, each block will be painted by a rectangle that is
      painted with the current background color of the block.</P>

    	change the function displayed in the graph and when you close the graph window.
