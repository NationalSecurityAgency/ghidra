/// \brief Algorithm for selecting unstructured edges based an Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
///
/// With the exception of the back edges in loops, structured code tends to form a DAG.
/// Within the DAG, all building blocks of structured code have a single node entry point
/// and (at most) one exit block. Given root points, this class traces edges with this kind of
/// structure.  Paths can recursively split at any point, starting a new \e active BranchPoint, but
/// the BranchPoint can't be \e retired until all paths emanating from its start either terminate
/// or come back together at the same FlowBlock node. Once a BranchPoint is retired, all the edges
/// traversed from the start FlowBlock to the end FlowBlock are likely structurable. After pushing
/// the traces as far as possible and retiring as much as possible, any \e active edge left
/// is a candidate for an unstructured branch.
///
/// Ultimately this produces a list of \e likely \e gotos, which is used whenever the structuring
/// algorithm (ActionBlockStructure) gets stuck.
///
/// The tracing can be restricted to a \e loopbody by setting the top FlowBlock of the loop as
/// the root, and the loop exit block as the finish block.  Additionally, any edges that
/// exit the loop should be marked using LoopBody::setExitMarks().
