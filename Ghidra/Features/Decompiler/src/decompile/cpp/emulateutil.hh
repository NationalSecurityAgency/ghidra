///    - setVarnodeValue()
///    - getLoadImageValue()
///
/// The default executeLoad() implementation pulls values from the underlying LoadImage
/// object. The following p-code ops are provided \e NULL implementations, as some tasks
/// don't need hard emulation of them:
///   - STORE
///   - CPOOLREF
