/** \page sleighAPIemulate The SLEIGH Emulator
    
  \section emu_overview Overview
  
  \b SLEIGH provides a framework for emulating the processors which have a specification written
   for them.  The key classes in this framework are:

  \b Key \b Classes
    - \ref MemoryState
    - \ref MemoryBank
    - \ref BreakTable
    - \ref BreakCallBack
    - \ref Emulate
    - \ref EmulatePcodeCache

  The MemoryState object holds the representation of registers and memory during emulation.  It
  understands the address spaces defined in the \b SLEIGH specification and how data is encoded
  in these spaces.  It also knows any register names defined by the specification, so these
  can be used to set or query the state of these registers naturally.

  The emulation framework can be tailored to a particular environment by creating \b breakpoint
  objects, which derive off the BreakCallBack interface.  These can be used to create callbacks
  during emulation that have full access to the memory state and the emulator, so any action
  can be accomplished.  The breakpoint callbacks can be designed to either augment or replace
  the instruction at a particular address, or the callback can be used to implement the action
  of a user-defined pcode op.  The BreakCallBack objects are managed by the BreakTable object,
  which takes care of invoking the callback at the appropriate time.

  The Emulate object serves as a basic execution engine.  Its main method is
  Emulate::executeCurrentOp() which executes a single pcode operation on the memory state.
  Methods exist for querying and setting the current execution address and examining the pcode
  op being executed.

  The main implementation of the Emulate interface is the EmulatePcodeCache object.  It uses
  SLEIGH to translate machine instructions as they are executed.  The currently executing instruction
  is translated into a cached sequence of pcode operations.  Additional methods allow this entire
  sequence to be inspected, and there is another stepping function which allows the emulator
  to be stepped through an entire machine instruction at a time.  The single pcode stepping methods
  are of course still available and the two methods can be used together without conflict.

  \section emu_membuild Building a Memory State

  Assuming the SLEIGH Translate object and the LoadImage object have already been built
  (see \ref sleighAPIbasic), the only required step left before instantiating an emulator
  is to create a MemoryState object.  The MemoryState object can be instantiated simply by
  passing the constructor the Translate object, but before it will work properly, you need
  to register individual MemoryBank objects with it, for each address space that might
  get used by the emulator.

  A MemoryBank is a representation of data stored in a single address space
  There are some choices for the type of MemoryBank associated with an address space.
  A MemoryImage is a read-only memory bank that gets its data from a LoadImage.  In order
  to make this writeable, or to create a writeable memory bank which starts with its bytes
  initialized to zero, you can use a MemoryHashOverlay or a MemoryPageOverlay.

  A MemoryHashOverlay overlays some other memory bank, such as a MemoryImage.  If you read
  from a location that hasn't been written to directly before, you get the data in the underlying
  memory bank.  But if you write to this overlay, the value is stored in a hash table, and
  subsequent reads will return this value.  Internally, the hashtable stores values in a \e preferred
  wordsize only on aligned addresses, but this is irrelevant to the interface. Unaligned requests
  are split up and handled transparently.

  A MemoryPageOverlay overlays another memory bank as well.  But it implements writes to the bank
  by caching memory \e pages.  Any write creates an aligned page to hold the new data.  The class
  takes care of loading and filling in pages as needed.

  Here is an example of instantiating a MemoryState and registering memory banks for a
  \e ram space which is initialized with the load image. The \e ram space is implemented
  with the MemoryPageOverlay, and the \e register space and the \e temporary space are implemented
  using the MemoryHashOverlay.

  \code
    void setupMemoryState(Translate &trans,LoadImage &loader) {
      // Set up memory state object
      MemoryImage loadmemory(trans.getDefaultCodeSpace(),8,4096,&loader);
      MemoryPageOverlay ramstate(trans.getDefaultCodeSpace(),8,4096,&loadmemory);
      MemoryHashOverlay registerstate(trans.getSpaceByName("register"),8,4096,4096,(MemoryBank *)0);
      MemoryHashOverlay tmpstate(trans.getUniqueSpace(),8,4096,4096,(MemoryBank *)0);

      MemoryState memstate(&trans);	// Instantiate the memory state object
      memstate.setMemoryBank(&ramstate);
      memstate.setMemoryBank(&registerstate);
      memstate.setMemoryBank(&tmpstate);
   }
  \endcode

  All the memory bank constructors need a preferred wordsize, which is most relevant to the hashtable
  implementation, and a page size, which is most relevant to the page implementation.  The hash
  overlays need an additional initializer specifying how big the hashtable should be.  The
  null pointers passed in, in place of a real memory bank, indicate that the memory bank is initialized
  with all zeroes. Once the memory banks are instantiated, they are registered with the memory state
  via the MemoryState::setMemoryBank() method.

  \section emu_breakpoints Breakpoints

  In order to provide behavior within the emulator beyond just what the core instruction emulation
  provides, the framework supports \b breakpoint classes.  A breakpoint is created by deriving a
  class from the BreakCallBack class and overriding either BreakCallBack::addressCallback() or
  BreakCallBack::pcodeCallback().  Here is an example of a breakpoint that implements a
  standard C library \e puts call an the x86 architecture.  When the breakpoint is invoked,
  a call to \e puts has just been made, so the stack pointer is pointing to the return address
  and the next 4 bytes on the stack are a pointer to the string being passed in.

  \code
    class PutsCallBack : public BreakCallBack {
    public:
      virtual bool addressCallback(const Address &addr);
    };

    bool PutsCallBack::addressCallback(const Address &addr)

    {
      MemoryState *mem = emulate->getMemoryState();
      uint1 buffer[256];
      uint4 esp = mem->getValue("ESP");
      AddrSpace *ram = mem->getTranslate()->getSpaceByName("ram");

      uint4 param1 = mem->getValue(ram,esp+4,4);
      mem->getChunk(buffer,ram,param1,255);

      cout << (char *)&buffer << endl;

      uint4 returnaddr = mem->getValue(ram,esp,4);
      mem->setValue("ESP",esp+8);
      emulate->setExecuteAddress(Address(ram,returnaddr));
  
      return true;			// This replaces the indicated instruction
    }
      
  \endcode

  Notice that the callback retrieves the value of the stack pointer by name.  Using this
  value, the string pointer is retrieved, then the data for the actual string is retrieved.
  After dumping the string to standard out, the return address is recovered and the \e return
  instruction is emulated by explicitly setting the next execution address to be the return value.

  \section emu_finalsetup Running the Emulator
  Here is an example of instantiating an EmulatePcodeCache object. A breakpoint is also instantiated
  and registered with the BreakTable.  

  \code
    ...
    Sleigh trans(&loader,&context);    // Instantiate the translator
    ...
    MemoryState memstate(&trans);      // Instantiate the memory state
    ...
    BreakTableCallBack breaktable(&trans);  // Instantiate a breakpoint table
    EmulatePcodeCache emulator(&trans,&memstate,&breaktable);  // Instantiate the emulator

    // Set up the initial stack pointer
    memstate.setValue("ESP",0xbffffffc);
    emulator.setExecuteAddress(Address(trans.getDefaultCodeSpace(),0x1D00114));  // Initial execution address
    
    PutsCallBack putscallback;
    breaktable.registerAddressCallback(Address(trans.getDefaultCodeSpace(),0x1D00130),&putscallback);

    AssemblyRaw assememit;
    for(;;) {
      Address addr = emulator.getExecuteAddress();
      trans.printAssembly(assememit,addr);
      emulator.executeInstruction();
    }

  \endcode

  Notice how the initial stack pointer and initial execute address is set up.  The breakpoint
  is registered with the BreakTable, giving it a specific address.  The executeInstruction method
  is called inside the loop, to actually run the emulator.  Notice that a disassembly of each
  instruction is printed after each step of the emulator.

  Other information can be examined from within this execution loop or in other tailored breakpoints.
  In particular, the Emulate::getCurrentOp() method can be used to retrieve the an instance
  of the currently executing pcode operation. From this starting point, you can examine the
  low-level objects:
    - PcodeOpRaw   and
    - VarnodeData
