    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Decompiler plugin is a sophisticated transformation engine which automatically
      converts the binary representation of individual functions into a high-level C
      representation. The Decompiler presents a view of a program which is interactive and
      dynamically updated as the user adds or makes changes to the annotations associated with the
      program. A Decompiler window maintains the correspondence between the C representation and
      the assembly representation displayed in the Code Browser window, to the extent possible. The
      window allows instant visual association and navigation between C language expressions and
      their corresponding assembly instructions.</P>

      <P>To display the decompiler window, position the cursor on a function in the Code Browser,
      then select the <IMG alt="" src="images/decompileFunction.gif" border="0"> icon from the tool
      bar, or the <B>Decompile</B> option from the <B>Window</B> menu in the tool.</P>

      <P><A name="Capabilities"></A>Some of the primary capabilities of the decompiler include:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI><I><B>Recovers Expressions</B></I>: The decompiler does full dataflow analysis which
        allows it to perform slicing on functions. The most tangible benefit to the user is that
        complicated expressions, which have been split into distinct operations/instructions and
        then mixed together with other instructions by the compiling/optimizing process, are
        reconstituted into a single expression again by the decompiler.</LI>

        <LI><I><B>Recovers High-Level Scoped Variables</B></I>: The decompiler understands how
        compilers use processor stacks and registers to implement variables with different scopes
        within a function. Data-flow allows it to follow what was originally a single variable as it
        moves from the stack, into a register, into a different register, etc. Thus it can
        effectively recover the original programs concept of a variable, minimizing the need to
        introduce artificial variables in the output.</LI>

        <LI><I><B>Recovers Function Parameters</B></I>: The decompiler understands the parameter
        passing conventions of the compiler and can reconstruct the form of the original function
        call.</LI>

        <LI><I><B>Uses Data type, Name, and Signature Annotations</B></I>: The decompiler
        automatically pulls in all the different data types and variable names that the user has
        applied to functions, and the C output is altered to reflect this. High-level variables are
        appropriately named, structure fields and array indices are calculated and displayed with
        correct syntax, constant char pointers are replaced with appropriate quoted strings,
        etc.</LI>

        <LI><I><B>Performs Local Type Propagation</B></I>: In the absence of information, the
        decompiler does its best to fill in information from what it does know. Variables whose
        data type has not been explicitly labeled by the user can often by recovered by seeing how
        the variable is used or by allowing the known data types to propagate.</LI>

        <LI><SPAN style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Can be used to Automatically
        Recover Structure Fields</SPAN>:&nbsp; The decompiler can be leveraged to recover
        references to a structure.<BR>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The decompiler will attempt to combine different locations (stack, memory, register) for
        variables within a function. Data type information for variables is gathered automatically
        from several sources. Any annotated function signatures, both of the function and of any
        sub-functions it calls, provide type information. If the function contains references to
        global memory locations that have a data type applied to them, these will also be used, and
        any local variables of the function can be annotated directly with data types. The user can
        provide data-type information to the decompiler by annotating all these sources. The more
        information that can be provided the better the produced C-code will be.</P>

        <P>Variables not labeled directly are assigned types by analyzing local type propagation.
        Typically, assigning data types to a few key variables dramatically improves the
        readability of the C-code, as propagation will accurately fill in all the other data types.
        Assigning types in function signatures and to global variables is particularly effective
        because of their effect across multiple functions simultaneously.</P>

        <P><IMG alt="" src="../../shared/note.png" border="0">If you have C-header files for an API

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Specifying data types for function parameters is especially useful. A function that has
        data types defined for its parameters will propagate these types into the variables of any
        calling functions.</P>

        <P>C variable argument conventions, or varargs, are are also supported. For instance, if
        the user has identified the standard C library routine <I>printf</I>, the signature can be
        defined to be void printf (char *, ...). Now whenever printf() is called, the decompiler
        will display the correct number of variable arguments.</P>

        <P>Function signatures can be applied from a Ghidra data type database. Windows data types
        and standard C library function signatures are included with the standard distribution.
        More definitions will be added in the future.<BR>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Occasionally, the decompiler may use one of several internal decompiler functions that
        don't get transformed into more 'C'-like expressions. Use of these can indicate that the
        pcode is incorrect or needs to be "Tuned" to make the decompiler output better. It can also
        mean that the decompiler needs an additional simplification rule to take care of that
        particular situation.<BR>

            </FONT></P>

            <P>This usually crops up when a 1-byte sized (char) variable is being stored in a
            4-byte register. All the basic arithmetic/logical ops on the 4-byte register give the
            correct result for doing the operation on a 1-byte variable; the compiler just has to
            make sure to ignore the 3 most significant bytes of the register. The CONCAT31 is the
            decompiler keeping track of these most significant bytes that the compiler was ignoring
            because it is mistakenly interpreting the register variable as being a 4-byte variable.
            In many cases the decompiler can figure this out, but especially in looping constructs,
            it cannot. This is really a dead code issue. The decompiler currently makes judgements
            about dead code for entire varnodes. A full fix of this problem would require a dead
            code elimination algorithm that could decide if part of a varnode were dead.<BR>

        <LI>A good way to start using the decompiler is by defining the parameters to functions

            <LI>The decompiler can work out references to fields of a data structure and figure out
            array indexing given enough information about data types. Building these data type
            definitions greatly enhances readability of the C-code and is a natural way to
            encapsulate reverse engineering knowledge. If you notice many offset references from a
            base value other than the frame or stack pointer, that value is probably pointing to a
            structure or an array. Notice psParm1 in the code below. There are several different
            references off of it. The parameter can be annotated to point to a structure. The user

        <P>For certain functions, the decompiler may produce an error message, produce incorrect
        code, or simply exit without producing results. Selecting <B><IMG alt="\/" src=
        "../../shared/menu16.gif"> Debug Function Decompilation</B>, from the decompiler provider
        window toolbar, will run the decompiler again, and save all relevant information to an XML
        file. Instead of submitting the entire program to be analyzed to discover the problem, only
        a small XML file is needed.<BR>

        <P>You can export the current decompiled function to a file by selecting the <IMG alt=""

        A file chooser dialog is displayed for you to select the name of the output file. If you do
        not specify a file extension, ".c" is appended to the filename.</P>
