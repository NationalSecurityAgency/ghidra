    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The data graph is a graph display that shows data objects in memory. Each data vertex
      displays a scrollable view of a data object and its contents.</P> 
      
      <P>Initially, a data graph is generated from a specific data program location. The graph
      will be populated with one data vertex showing the data for that location. From this original
      source vertex, the references to and from this vertex can be explored to add additional
      vertices to the graph. In the data vertex display, any data elements that have an outgoing
      reference will have an <IMG src="Icons.RIGHT_ICON" alt="" border="0"> icon that can be clicked
      to quickly explore that reference.</P>
      
      <P>If a reference leads from/to code, a simple code vertex is generated
      that simply shows the function and offset of the reference from the function's entry point. 
      For the purposes of the data graph, code vertices are end points and cannot be explored 
      further.</P>

      <P>The display consists of the <A href="#Primary_View">Primary View</A> and an optional <A
      href="help/topics/VisualGraph/Visual_Graph.html#Satellite_View">Satellite View</A>.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Primary_View"></A>Primary View</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>      
      <P>The primary view shows an initial data object that was used to create the graph. This
      data vertex can be used to explore references and pointers. As you explore, new vertices
      will be added to the graph. All vertices in the graph can trace a reference relationship
      back to the original source data object.</P>
      
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><IMG src="help/shared/tip.png" alt="" border="0">The original source data vertex
      has a <IMG src="Icons.HOME_ICON" alt="" border="0"> icon in its header to indicate it is the original source vertex.</P>

    <H3>Data Vertices</H3>
    
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Data vertices show information about the data and values they contain. If the vertex
      datatype is a primitive, such as an int, the vertex contains only one row that shows its name
      and value. If the data is more complex such as a structure or array, the vertex will display
      multiple rows showing the name and value of each field in the structure. If the structure
      contains other structures or arrays of data, those data items can be expanded in a tree/table
      structure showing the names and values of that internal data.</P>
	  
	  <P>Any elements that are pointers (or have attached outgoing references) will display a
	  <IMG src="Icons.RIGHT_ICON" alt="" border="0"> icon that can be clicked to explore those
	  references to add new vertices.</P>

      <P>Data vertices can be resized by dragging the bottom right corner. Also, the interior column
      sizes can be adjusted by hovering the mouse on a column boundary and dragging left or
      right.</P>
      
      <P>The header of a vertex contains the name of the label and/or address of the data object.
      The header also contains buttons that allow you to perform some common operations on the
      vertex.</P>

      <P>As long as you are within the <A href="help/topics/VisualGraph/Visual_Graph.html#Interaction_Threshold">interaction threshold</A>,
      you may interact with the vertex to expand/collapse sub-data elements and to click on any
      pointer references to add vertices to the graph.</P>

	<H3>Code Vertices</H3>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Generally vertices in the graph show data objects, but a vertex can also represent a
      reference from or to code. In the data graph, code vertices are terminal vertices, simply
      showing the function name and offset into or out of that function.</P>

      <P>In the image above, the graph is showing two references to the same string.</P>

      <H3><A name="Layout">Vertex Layout</A></H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>The data graph uses a special layout to attempt to maintain a logical structure as
		more vertices are added to the graph. This layout uses the exploration order
		to layout the vertices.</P>

		<P>Starting with the original data vertex. All vertices that were
		added to the graph by following outgoing references are displayed in a column to the right of 
		the vertex. Within this column, the vertices are ordered by the order they are first referenced
		from the source vertex.</P>
		
		<P>Similarly, vertices added to the graph by following incoming references are shown in a 
		column to the left of the source vertex. Within this column, the vertices are ordered by 
		address.</P>
		
		<P>Additional layers of vertices can be added by further exploring the child vertices and their
		descendants. These additional vertices are ordered in the same way relative to their immediate
		source vertex.</P>
		
		<P>Whenever a vertex is removed from the graph, all vertices that were discovered by exploring
		from that vertex are also removed.</P>

      <H3>Vertex Actions</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The following toolbar actions are available on a data vertex.</P>

        <UL>
          <LI><A name="Expand_All"><IMG alt="" src="Icons.EXPAND_ALL_ICON">&nbsp<B> Expand All</B> -
          Expands all expandable sub-data elements recursively contained in the data object. Note
          that this action is not available if the data has no sub-data elements.</A></LI>

          <LI><A name="Collapse_All"><IMG alt="" src="Icons.COLLAPSE_ALL_ICON">&nbsp<B>Collapse All</B>
          - Collapses all expanded sub-data elements. Note that this action is not available if the
          data has no sub-data elements.</A></LI>

          <LI><A name="Delete_Vertex"><IMG alt="" src="Icons.CLOSE_ICON">&nbsp<B>Delete Vertex</B> - Removes this vertex and all vertices
          that descend from this vertex.</A></LI>
        </UL>

        <P><A name="Popups">The following popup actions are are available depending on where the
        mouse is positioned when the popup is triggered.</A></P>

        <UL>
          <LI><A name="Add_Outgoing"><B>Add All Outgoing References</B> - All outgoing references
          from this data element or its sub-elements will generate a new vertex in the graph, if
          not already present.</A></LI>

          <LI><A name="Add_Incoming"><B>Add All Incoming References</B> - The program will be
          searched for any references to this data element or its sub-elents and a new vertex be
          created each discovered reference, if not already present.</A></LI>

          <LI><A name="Expand_Fully"><B>Expand Fully</B> - If the mouse is over an
          expandable row in data vertex, the vertex and all it's child elements will be fully
          expanded.</A></LI>

          <LI><A name="Original_Source"><B>Set Original Source</B> - Makes this the original source
          root vertex. All other vertices are reorganized and laid out as if they were discovered
          by following references from this vertex.See</A> <A href="#Layout">Vertex
          Layout.</A></LI>

          <LI><A name="Delete_Selected"><B>Delete Selected Vertices</B> - Deletes the selected
          vertices and any descendants vertices (vertices that were discovered via exploring from 
          that vertex.)</A></LI>

        <H3>Selecting Vertices</H3>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Left-clicking a vertex will select that vertex. To select multiple vertices, hold down
          the <B><TT>Ctrl</TT></B> key while clicking. To deselect
          a block, hold the <TT>Ctrl</TT> key while clicking the block. To clear all selected
          blocks, click in an empty area of the primary view. When selected, a block is adorned
          with a halo.</P>

          <P>You may also select multiple vertices in one action by holding the <B><TT>Ctrl</TT></B> key
          while performing a drag operation. Press the <B><TT>Ctrl</TT></B> key and start the drag in an
          empty area of the primary view (not over a vertex). This will create a bounding rectangle
          on the screen that will select any vertices contained therein when the action is
          finished.</P>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

        <H3>Navigating Vertices</H3>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>By default the data graph can be used to navigate the main views of the tool. Clicking
          on a vertex or a row within a vertex will generate a goto event for that address, causing
          the main tool to navigate to that location. See the actions below to turn off this
          behavior.</P>

          <P>Also, the data graph can listen for tool location changes and select the appropriate
          vertex in the graph if any vertices contain the tool location address. This behavior is
          off by default, but can be turn on via a popup action.</P>
