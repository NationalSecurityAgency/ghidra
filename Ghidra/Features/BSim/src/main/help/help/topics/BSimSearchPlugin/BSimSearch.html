    <H1>BSim Search</H1>

    <P>The BSim Search features allows the user to perform similar function searches against an
    existing BSim database. See the <A class="link" href="../BSim/BSimOverview.html">BSim
    Overview</A> for a full description of BSim. This section describes the actions and related
    GUIs for conducting either an overview search or a similar functions search and the follow on
    actions that can be performed on the search results.</P>

    <H2><A name="Adding_BSim_Plugin"></A>Enabling the BSim Search Plugin</H2>

    <P>The BSim Database feature comes with an Ghidra GUI interface for initiating searches. This
    GUI integrates with Ghidra via a plug-in that can be added to the main Ghidra Code Browser
    tool. This plug-in is currently called the <B>BSimSearchPlugin</B> within Ghidra and can be
    enabled from within the <B>Configure Tool</B>menu. If the plug-in is enabled, the Code Browser
    will contain a BSim menu with actions for managing BSim database definitions, performing an
    overview query, or perfrorming a similar functions search. Also, the <IMG alt="" src=
    "icon.bsim.query.dialog.provider">&nbsp; will appear in the toolbar, which is a shortcut for
    search similar fuctions action.</P>

      <P>Before a BSim overview or search can be performed, one or more BSim database
      specifications must be defined. BSim database specifications are managed by the BSim Server
      Manager dialog.</P>

      <P>The server dialog can be invoked either from main toolbar, <B>BSim<IMG src=

    <P>When trying to use the Executable Match Summary to determine if there is a significant match
    between the currently active program and executables in the database, there are two potential
    sources of noise in the resulting scores. Very small functions can produce false positives
    which artificially increase the confidence score for a particular executable. Also, some
    functions, like those provided by standard language libraries, may be used by a large portion
    of the executables in the corpus, and incorporating their matches into confidence scores
    obscures more significant matches. In both cases, the functions have an overly large number of
    matches in the database. This table, preferably sorted on the Hit Count column, serves as an
    overview of what, within the context of the active program, are the most common and least
    common functions in the database. This makes it easy to filter out precisely these kinds of
    problem functions.</P>

    <P>The standard procedure is to select an upper-bound for a function's Hit Count, select every
    row in the table below that threshold, and then transfer that selection to the main Code
    Browser window by clicking on the Make a selection icon in the upper right corner of the table.
    Then, with selection active, invoke the <A href="#BSim_Search_Dialog">Search Similar
    Functions</A>.</P>

    <H2><A name="BSim_Search_Dialog"></A>BSim Similar Function Search</H2>

    <P>The BSim Similar Function Search action performs a BSim search against one or more functions
    in the current program. If there is a selection, it will search all functions in the selection;
    otherwise it will search on the one function containing the cursor (If the cursor is not in the
    body of any function, an error dialog will appear).</P>

    <P>To invoke an overview search dialog, select <B>BSim<IMG src="help/shared/arrow.gif" alt=

        or the number of functions being searched. Press the <IMG alt="" src=
        "icon.bsim.functions.table"> button to see a list of all the selected functions.</LI>

        <LI><A name="Similarity"></A><B>Similarity Threshold</B> - This is a score between 0.0
        and 1.0 indicating as a percentage how similar two functions are to each other and is
        calculated as a Cosine Similarity on their feature sets. For two functions that are about
        the same size, a similarity score of 0.85 indicates that they share about 85% of their
        features. The score takes into account the relative importance of individual features and
        will vary from a raw feature percentage.</LI>

        <LI><A name="Confidence"></A><B>Confidence Threshold</B> - Enter a minimum confidence
        threshold for matches. Confidence is an unbounded score that indicates how likely it is for
        a given pair of functions to be a causal match. Formally, confidence is a log likelihood
        ratio that accumulates positive scores for features in common and negative scores for
        differences. The larger the score, the more significant the result.</LI>

      Categories</A>. The column name will match the formal category name, and the string values
      can be sorted like any other column. It is possible for multiple values to be assigned to the
      same category for a single executable. In this case, the results table will still display a
      single column, but the cell will display all the values as a sorted and comma-separated list.
      If a new date column is specifically added to the database, this will <SPAN class=

      check-box, indicating whether the tag was present for that function or not.</P>

      <H3>Executable Match Summary</H3>

      <P>The Executable March Summary table displays a row for each executable that has at least
      one matching function for the queried function(s). Every function returned as a match is
      associated with its own executable. This table lists exactly one row for every executable
      associated with some function match, even if there is more than one such match. Many of the
      columns are the same as for the Function Match table, but there are two columns that show an
      aggregated value over all function matches that share that same executable.</P>

      <UL>
        <LI><B>Confidence</B> - For a query taken from functions in an <I>unknown</I> executable,
        the greater the number of function matches that come from a single executable, the more
        significant that executable is overall as a match to the unknown executable. The <B>per
        executable</B> confidence quantifies this by summing all the function match confidence
        scores into a single executable score.</LI>

        <LI><B>Function Count</B> - A simple count of the number of function matches that share
        this same executable.</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>The executables with the highest aggregate <I>confidence</I> scores share the highest
      amount of functionality with the subset of functions in the active program that were queried.
      Users should be aware that this shared functionality is not necessarily the most important
      functionality. Small functions can produce false positive matches that artificially inflate a
      confidence score, and matches to library functions increase the score even though the shared
      functionality is not significant. Proper filtering of the queried subset and of the results
      may be crucial to getting a meaningful result. See <A href="#BSim_Overview_Dialog">The
      Overview Query</A>.</P>

      corresponding to the BSim Database is running. Every executable record in the database has a
      URL field providing the host, repository, and path for retrieval. If the executable records
      were ingested from a Ghidra server using the standard tools, this field should be populated
      correctly.</P>

      <P>The code comparison is triggered by right-clicking on a particular entry in the Function
      Match table and selecting <I>Compare Function</I> from the resulting pop-up. If the Ghidra
      server containing the executable is running, it will be loaded as a separate program directly
      into the current Code Browser and a comparison window will be displayed. If the Ghidra server
      is not running, or if the URL field is missing from the record, the comparison will still be
      triggered if the matching executable is loaded manually as a program in the same Code
      Browser. The menu action will identify the executable by name.</P>

      <H3>Loading Executables</H3>

      <P>An executable can be loaded into the Code Browser, without immediately triggering a
      function comparison, by right-clicking on a row in the Executables Summary table and
      selecting <I>Load Executable</I> from the corresponding pop-up menu.</P>

    <H2><A name="BSim_Authentication">Authentication</A></H2>

    <P>Depending on the configuration of the database (See <A href=
    "../BSim/DatabaseConfiguration.html#PostSecurityAuthentication">Security and
    Authentication</A>), the user may need to authenticate themselves with the BSim server. This
    check will be performed immediately upon selected a server definition. If the server requires a
    password, a separate dialog will be brought up.</P>

    <P>By default Ghidra will connect as the username reported by the OS, but in the password
    dialog, a different username can be entered if this doesn't match the account established on
    the server. The title bar of the main dialog indicates the username being used for the current
    connection.</P>

    <P>If the BSim server requires PKI authentication, the user must register their certificate
    with the Ghidra client. This is accomplished from the main Project window by selecting <B>Set
    PKI Certificate...</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu and pointing the dialog at the certificate
    file. The same certificate is used for authenticating with BSim and with a Ghidra server, if
    either require PKI. Ghidra will typically bring up a password dialog once per session to unlock
    the certificate at the first point it is required.</P>
