        <P>The server for the BSim Database is distinct from the traditional Ghidra server,
        although for many use cases it is convenient to have both running and view the BSim server
        as a loosely coupled extension to the base Ghidra Server. In terms of start-up, shutdown,
        and configuration however, the two servers are completely separate.</P>

        <P>There are two choices for deploying a shared server for the BSim Database: PostgreSQL or
          Elasticsearch. Both options support multiple users and allow multiple simultaneous connections
	  to the remote server.  A single database can ingest large datasets, while
	  still maintaining short query times.</P>
	<P>
	  Alternately, a single user can create a BSim database on their local file-system,
	  without a server, by utilizing the H2 database engine integrated into Ghidra. This option
	  is intended for querying against small datasets and does not require installation of
	  additional server software.</P>

        <P>A PostgreSQL server, which must be built with a BSim specific extension,
          runs on a single host and makes efficient use of whatever CPU, memory, and disk resources
	  are made available to it. PostgreSQL is a robust and capable server that should perform well
	  on minimally configured workstations up to high-end production hardware. Source for the
	  BSim extension to PostgreSQL is included as part of the Ghidra installation, but the
	  PostgreSQL source may need to be obtained separately by the database administrator.
	  See <A class="xref" href="DatabaseConfiguration.html#PostBuild">&ldquo;Building the Server&rdquo;</A>
	</P>

        <P>An Elasticsearch server, which must have a BSim specific plug-in installed, runs
          as a scalable database that automatically distributes itself across machines in a cluster,
	  allowing individual database queries and requests to be serviced in parallel. The Elasticsearch
	  BSim plug-in is included with the Ghidra installation, but the core server software must be obtained
	  separately by the database administrator.
	  See <A class="xref" href="DatabaseConfiguration.html#ElasticInstall">&ldquo;Installing the Plug-in&rdquo;</A>
	</P>

        <P>BSim clients included in the base Ghidra distribution can interface to any of these
          databases. Users that just want to connect to an existing shared server via a BSim client do not need to
	  install any server software themselves.</P>

            <P>In order to use PostgreSQL as a BSim server, it must be built with a BSim specific
              extension, provided as part of the Ghidra installation. Prebuilt servers, like those
              provided as OS distribution packages, will not work as is with BSim. For users on Linux
              and macOS, the Ghidra installation provides a script, <CODE>make-postgres.sh</CODE>,
              in the module directory <CODE>Ghidra/Features/BSim/support</CODE> that builds both the PostgreSQL
              server and the BSim extension from source and prepares the installation for use with
              Ghidra.  If not already included in the Ghidra installation, the source distribution
              file, currently <CODE>postgresql-15.3.tar.gz</CODE>, can be obtained from the PostgreSQL
              website at </P>

            <P>The <SPAN class="bold"><STRONG>start</STRONG></SPAN> command can take an optional

            <P>BSim makes use of PostgreSQL security mechanisms to enforce privileges and

            wraps the subset of functionality described here, but other adjustments are possible by
            connecting directly to the server and issuing SQL commands.</P>

            <P>The PostgreSQL server, as configured for BSim, only accepts connections via SSL, so
            communications in transit are always encrypted regardless of the authentication
            settings.</P>

            <P>PostgreSQL uses the concept of <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>roles</EM></SPAN> to grant
            access privileges based on particular users. Generally, a user's role is determined by
            the <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>username</EM></SPAN> used to establish the connection.
            For BSim, each user role is granted one of two privilege levels: <SPAN class=
            "command"><STRONG>user</STRONG></SPAN>, which allows read-only access to the server for
            normal queries, and <SPAN class="command"><STRONG>admin</STRONG></SPAN>, which
            additionally allows database creation, ingest, update, and deletion.</P>

            <P>BSim supports three different authentication methods, when connecting as a client or
            during database ingest and maintenance. This method is established for a server by the
            initial <SPAN class="command"><STRONG>start</STRONG></SPAN> command.</P>

                    option from the Project dialog. The BSim client will automatically submit the
                    certificate to a server that requests it, and the password to unlock it will be
                    requested as needed. This is the same mechanism used to a access a PKI
                    protected Ghidra server, and if a user needs access to both a BSim server and
                    Ghidra server that are PKI protected, the servers should probably be configured

        case of an H2 file-based database there is no server requirement. Only after a database has

        single container of reverse engineered functions. Metadata pertaining to executables and
        call-graph relationships is also stored, but the principle database record describes a
        <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>function</EM></SPAN>. A single PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch
        server can hold multiple independent databases.</P>

        <P>A database is created using the <SPAN class="command"><STRONG>bsim</STRONG></SPAN>

        <P>A BSim database is completely distinct from the Ghidra Server or Ghidra project, so the
        executables and functions contained within do not need to coincide at all.</P>

        <P>The Ghidra GUI client specifies a BSim database with its explicit characteristics (i.e.,
        DB type, name, host/port if applicable, etc.), while the <SPAN class=
        "command"><STRONG>bsim</STRONG></SPAN> command accepts a <SPAN class=
        "emphasis"><EM>bsimURL</EM></SPAN> which includes similar details (see <A class="xref"
        href="CommandLineReference.html#URLs">&ldquo;Ghidra and BSim URLs&rdquo;</A> for more
        details).</P>

        <P>The <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>config_template</EM></SPAN> parameter passed to <SPAN
        class="command"><STRONG>bsim createdatabase</STRONG></SPAN> names a collection of specific
        configuration values for the newly created database. A standard Ghidra distribution
        provides a number of predefined templates (See below) designed for specific database use
        cases. It is simplest to use a predefined template when creating a database, but it is
        possible to edit an existing template or create a new template (See <A class="xref" href=
        "DatabaseConfiguration.html#DatabaseTemplates" title=
        "Creating Database Templates">&ldquo;Creating Database Templates&rdquo;</A>).</P>

        <P>There are two critical database properties being determined by the template that need to
        be kept in mind: the <SPAN class="bold"><STRONG>index tuning</STRONG></SPAN> and the <SPAN
        class="bold"><STRONG>weighting scheme</STRONG></SPAN> relative to the size of the database.
        The two pieces of the template name, separated by the '_' character, refer to these
        concerns.</P>

        <P>The index tuning affects the use of the database by trading off between, the time
        required to perform individual queries, the amount of variation between matching functions
        a query can tolerate, and the amount of storage required per database record. Ideally, the
        database is tuned, before the initial ingest occurs, to the <SPAN class=
        "emphasis"><EM>anticipated size</EM></SPAN> of the database. The database can trade off
        storage size (per record) and latency for overall query response time, but the decision
        needs to be made before the database is populated. Currently there is a <SPAN class=
        "bold"><STRONG>medium</STRONG></SPAN> tuning that is ideal for repositories that will store
        on the order of 10 million functions. There is also a <SPAN class=
        "bold"><STRONG>large</STRONG></SPAN> tuning, which uses more storage but can maintain fast
        query times for databases with 100 million functions or more. There is a large overlap for
        these tunings, so if its unclear how large a database might grow, go ahead and use the
        medium tuning.</P>

        <P>The weighting scheme affects how BSim views the relative importance of individual code
        constructs within a function. Code constructions are extracted as <SPAN class=
        "emphasis"><EM>features</EM></SPAN>, and each feature is assigned a weight. The basic
        schemes are: <SPAN class="bold"><STRONG>32</STRONG></SPAN> for 32-bit compiled code, <SPAN
        class="bold"><STRONG>64</STRONG></SPAN> for 64-bit code. The scheme that matches the
        predominant form of code in the repository being ingested should be used. Mixed schemes are
        possible, but a corpus which is predominantly 32-bit, even with a small number of 64-bit
        executables mixed in, should still use the 32-bit weights.</P>

        <P>There are some weighting schemes designed for more specialized code. The <SPAN class=
        "bold"><STRONG>64_32</STRONG></SPAN> scheme is for 64-bit code using 32-bit pointers. The
        <SPAN class="bold"><STRONG>nosize</STRONG></SPAN> scheme allows better matching of 32-bit
        functions to 64-bit functions, when they are compiled from the same source. The <SPAN
        class="bold"><STRONG>cpool</STRONG></SPAN> scheme is designed for Java byte-code or Dalvik
        executables. For more discussion of weighting, see <A class="xref" href=
        "FeatureWeight.html#WeightingSoftware" title="Weighting Software Features">&ldquo;Weighting

          <P>BSim provides the powerful ability to associate new types of metadata with each
          executable that the database ingests. Any method of categorizing executables that
          describes an executable with a simple string value, referred to here as an executable
          <SPAN class="bold"><STRONG>category</STRONG></SPAN>, can be added as a field to the
          database. With only minor adjustments to the ingest process, new category values can be
          automatically attached to incoming executables and are treated like any other executable
          field that BSim understands. Category values are retrieved with queries, can be used for
          filtering, and show up as sortable columns in result tables.</P>

          <P>All categories have a formal name (or type), which is used both in the ingest process
          (See below) and as the label for table columns. The name can contain alphanumeric
          characters or punctuation from the limited set, ' ._:/()'. For each executable there can
          be zero, one, or more <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>string</EM></SPAN> values associated
          with the category. No value is required for the executable, and any single value can be
          used for filtering (either the executable is labeled with the value or it is not) even if
          there are multiple values for that category. If there are multiple values, a query that
          matches the executable will return all the values as a single sorted column entry.</P>

          <P>It is also possible to create a special time-based category. This category can have
          any name as above, but instead of associating string values with the executable, it
          associates a single time-stamp. The time-stamp has precision down to the millisecond and
          provides filtering and sorting based on time. Internally, this new category repurposes
          the column storage originally providing an executable's <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>Ingest
          Date</EM></SPAN> field. As a result, any BSim instance
          can have only one time category and only one time-stamp within it. The ingest scripting
          must provide any actual time-stamp value for the executable, or the database will fill in
          the "epoch", 12:00 am, Jan 1, 1970.</P>

          <P>A new category can be added to the database at any time using the <SPAN class=
          "command"><STRONG>bsim addexecategory</STRONG></SPAN> command.</P>

          <DIV class="informalexample">

          <P>The single time-stamp field can be renamed by appending the keyword "date" to the

          options set for any new executables will automatically read into the database as part of
          the ingest process. Previously ingested executables, assuming they have the new program
          options set, can be updated within the BSim database using one of the <SPAN class=
          "command"><STRONG>bsim updaterepo</STRONG></SPAN> command variants. In either case, the
          relevant program options typically need to be filled by running a Ghidra script (See <A

          <P>BSim can be configured to recognize specific <SPAN class="bold"><STRONG>Function
          Tags</STRONG></SPAN>, which are named Boolean properties on individual functions within
          an executable. Within a Ghidra program, any number of different function tags can be
          established by the user and are used to label individual functions or specific subsets of
          functions that share a particular property. This would typically be used to label classes
          of functions that are important to analysts, unpacked functions could be labeled with the
          tag <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>UNPACKED</EM></SPAN> for instance.</P>

          <P>In order for BSim to recognize specific function tags, they must be individually
          registered with the BSim database. These tags are then automatically ingested into the
          database, along with the other standard metadata describing functions, and can be used to
          filter match results when querying the database. A function tag has a formal name, which
          can be displayed as part of the function header within the main code browser and is used
          for BSim columns and filter labels. Once the tag is created for a program, functions
          universally have the tag as a Boolean property, either the name applies to a function or
          it doesn't, and arbitrary subsets can be <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>tagged</EM></SPAN>
          with that name.</P>

          <P>A tag must be <SPAN class="emphasis"><EM>registered</EM></SPAN> with a BSim database
