      Program Differences
    </h1>
    <p>The Code Browser can be used to view a second program alongside the
       tool's program to determine the differences between them. This is
       called a Program Diff. The Program Diff highlights code units in the
       second program to indicate there is a difference. Highlighted code
       units in the second program can then have their differences applied to
       the tool's program causing it to change. The ultimate goal is to apply 
       some or all of the differences from the second program to the tool's 
       program in order to get another user's changes into your program.

      <p>The tool's program, that will be modified by the Diff, is
         displayed on the left-hand-side of the Code Browser.
         The second program, where the differences to apply are obtained, is
         displayed on the right-hand-side. Markers in the right margin of the
         second program give an indication of all the positions in the current
         view where there are differences between the two programs. The view of
         both programs is still controlled by the program tree for the tool's
         program. In other words, the second program's view will only show
         addresses that match those viewed for the tool's program.<br>
         <img src="help/shared/tip.png" alt="">
         Notice that the difference highlights are light orange above. The selected
         difference is green. These are only the default colors. They can be
         changed from the tool's Options dialog (<b>Edit</b>
         <img src="help/shared/arrow.gif" alt="-&gt;"> 
         <b>O</b><b>ptions...</b>, open the <b>Listing Fields</b> folder,
         and select <b>Selection Colors</b>, double click on the <b>Difference</b>
         color).<br>
      </p>
      <p>Blank space is added to each program as necessary to align the
         addresses between the two programs. The vertical or horizontal
         scrollbar of either program causes both programs to scroll in a
         synchronized manner. Also, changing the cursor location in one program,
         changes it in the other program.
      </p>
      <p>The Program Diff colors the two programs where they differ. These
         differences can then be applied individually from the second program to
         the tool's program. Applying a difference changes the tool's program so
         it matches the second program where it was different previously. The
         ultimate goal is to apply some or all of the differences from the
         second program to the tool's program.
      </p>
      <p>Program Diff is most commonly used to compare different users' copies 
         of the same program. With versioned programs, it can also be used to 
         determine differences against an older version of the same program. 
         When working on a project as a team, each person can make changes to 
         his own copy of a program file. The Program Diff can then be used to 
         determine where the programs differ. Changes that another team member 
         has in his program can be merged into yours by applying the difference.

        <li>The second program has been changed since you last determined
          program differences.
        </li>
        <li>You want to determine differences for different addresses of
          the program than the current Diff used. For example, you initially
          determined program differences limited to a selection and now you want
          to know differences for the whole program or for a different set of
          selected addresses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When a second program is already displayed in the Code Browser
         tool, do the following to determine new program differences between
         that program and the tool's program.

      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <p align="left">From the toolbar above the second program, select

      Applying Differences
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Applying a difference, changes the tool's program to match the
         second program in the Program Diff for each type of difference being
         applied. The Program Diff can control which types of differences get
         applied from the second program to the tool's program 
         (see <a href="#Diff_Apply_Settings">Apply</a>). It can also control 
         whether some types of differences replace what is in the tool's program 
         or whether they are merged into the tool's program. Only the highlighted 
         code units in the second program, which are currently selected, can have 
         their differences applied.
      </p>
      <h3>To apply a selection </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Select Differences in the second program.</li>
        <li>Make sure the difference types you want to apply have their
          boxes checked in the <i>ProgramDiff Settings</i> dialog.
        </li>
        <li>Click the <b> Apply Selection</b> button 
          <img src="images/pencil16.png" border="0"> in the toolbar.<br>
          or<br>
          Press the Apply Selection hot key.<br>
          or<br>
          Click the right mouse on the highlighted difference and select the 
          <b>Apply Selection </b>button.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Remember all the types of differences that are being <b>Replaced </b>or
         <b>Merged </b>in the <a href="#Diff_Apply_Settings">
         <i>Diff Apply Settings</i></a>
         dockable component will be applied for the selected code units.
      </p>
      <p>When applying differences, comments and labels can be replaced
         with the second program's comments or merged with them. Merging comments 
         or labels in the Program Diff results in the union of the two programs 
         comments or labels for each code unit being applied.
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>A code unit in the tool's program does not have any comments or
         labels. The code unit in the second program has a pre-comment and a
         bookmark. All Apply boxes are checked. Apply a selection containing the
         code unit. The pre-comment and bookmark appear in the program in the
         Code Browser.
      </p>
      <p>Say the Bookmarks box in the Apply area of the settings dialog was
         not checked and the Comments box was checked when the difference was
         applied. The pre-comment would appear in the Code Browser's program,
         but the bookmark would not.

      <ul>
        <li>The code units appear different between the two programs,
          but are not highlighted.
        </li>
        <li>If a particular type of difference was not selected when
          differences were determined, then it will not get highlighted.
        </li>
        <li>If the thing that appears different is due to a difference
          elsewhere in the program, then it will not get highlighted. For
          example, XREFs are not a difference where they are shown. The code unit
          where the reference is from is different, not where the reference is
          to. The XREF is displayed on the code unit the reference is to.
        </li>
        <li>The code units appear the same between the two programs, but
          are highlighted. This can happen when there is something different
          about the code unit, but that thing is not displayable. For example,
          references are not visually displayed, but they are a valid difference
          at the code unit the reference is from.

        <li>The location is highlighted, but you want to know exactly
          what is different here.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In other words, are there other types of differences here besides
         the boxes I checked in the <i>Program Difference Settings</i> dialog?
         Remember, only the difference types with their Apply boxes checked in
         the dialog will be applied if an <i>Apply Selection </i>is done.<br>

    <h2>Problems/Limitations</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You cannot undo an <b>Ignore Selection</b> <img src="images/eraser_arrow16.png" alt="" border="0"> action. Undo of an
         <b>Apply Selection</b> or <b>Ignore Selection</b> in a Program Diff currently can't
         re-highlight the code units with differences that were ignored. If you want to get
         back differences after undo of an <b>Apply Selection</b> <img src="images/pencil_arrow16.png" alt="" border="0"> or if you want all ignored
         differences to no longer be ignored, you must re-Diff the programs by selecting the
         <b>Get Differences</b> button <img src="images/Diff16.png" alt="" border="0">.
