    <H1>Graphing the Program</H1>
    
    <H2>Graph Output</H2>
     
	<P>To display or export a graph, Ghidra supports multiple graph services. Ghidra has two
	built-in graph services; one to display a graph and one to export a graph.  Before invoking
	the graph actions described below, make sure to choose the desired graph service.  This choice
	will direct the output of the graph function to the active graph service.  To select a graph
	service, use the <B>Graph<IMG src="../../shared/arrow.gif">Graph Output</B></LI> menu.
	
	<H2>Graph types</H2>
    <P>Program control flow Graphs can be created and then shown using an appropriate graph service.
    A control flow graph is a representation of the flow from one portion of the code to
    another. The nodes of the graph represent blocks of code and the edges represent flow between
    the blocks of code.</P>

    <P>There are two basic flow graph types, <A href="#Graph_Block_Flow">Block Flow</A> and <A href=
    "#Graph_Calls_Using_Default_Model">Call Graph</A>. Different colors and shapes are used to
    depict each node and the flow between them.</P>
    
    <P><A href="#Data_Reference_Graph">Data graphs</A> show reference relationships between memory 
    locations. They can be constrained to just <B>"To References"</B>, just <B>"From References"</B>,
    or both. By default a single hop is graphed with the option to extend from within the 
    graph.</P>
    
    <P>Multiple graphs of any or all types can exist at any time.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>A <I>Call Graph</I> depicts subroutines as nodes. Calls between subroutines are shown as
      edges. Under normal circumstances all nodes are subroutine entry points (orange triangle) and
      all edges are calls (orange).</P>

      <P>A Block Flow graph is a little more complicated. Each node is a contiguous set of
      instructions or Code Block broken by an instruction that causes any type of flow. Move and
      arithmetic instructions cause no change in flow so they will not break a block. Jump, Call,
      and return instructions cause flow and will lie at the end of a Code Block. Block Flow graphs
      are useful for looking at the control flow within a function in compiled code. For embedded
      systems that have convoluted control flow structure, it may be beneficial to graph the entire
      program.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    	<H2>Graph Scope</H2>
	<P>When creating any of the graphs described below, the scope of the graph is determined by the
	current location and selection present in the listing. </P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<H3>If there is a selection:</H3>
		<BLOCKQUOTE><P> The graph will 
		include all the code that is selected and exclude all the code that is not selected.</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<H3>If there is no selection:</H3>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P> The scope is determined by the current cursor location and the type of graph:</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<H4>Current Location is in a Function</H4>
				<UL>
					<LI>Block Flow Graphs: The scope is the body of the containing functions</LI>
					<LI>Call Graphs: The scope is the containing function and all the functions that
					either call it or it calls</LI>
				</UL>
		<H4>Current Location is not in a Function</H4>
		<UL>
			<LI>the scope will be the entire program</LI>
		</UL>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><IMG src="../../shared/tip.png"> To graph the entire program, press "&lt;ctrl&gt; a" to
      select all before creating the graph.</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Synchronization</H2>

	<P>Selection and Location events are synchronized between each
    graph and the other windows in the tool.
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <H3>Selection</H3>

    <P>The current selection within the graph display is represented by a red box around selected 
    nodes as shown below on the node labeled "00408133". A node is selected if any addresses it represents are contained within the
    selection.</P>

    <P align="center"><IMG src="images/SelectGraphNode.png"></P>

    <P align="left"><BR>
     When a selection is made in the graph display, all addresses represented by each selected node become
    the new current selection within Ghidra.</P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png"> See the documentation for the specific graph display for
      descriptions of how to to make selections and navigate the graph.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><IMG src="../../shared/tip.png"> A selection in one graph can be used to create a follow
      on graph. When a graph is created, only blocks of code that fall within the current selection
      will be part of the graph. For example, a single subroutine could be selected in a Call
      Graph. From that selection, a <A href="#Graph_Block_Flow">Block Flow</A> graph can be created
      from the basic blocks found within the selected subroutine.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3>Location</H3>

    <P>The node containing the current address location is marked with a large red arrow as shown
    below on the graph node labeled "00408133".</P>

    <P align="center"><IMG src="images/FocusGraphNode.png"></P>

    <P align="left">Whenever the cursor location changes in the Code Browser (or tool that created
    the graph), the red arrow location on the graph is updated. The current location is also
    changed when a selection of nodes is made within the graph display. The minimum address of all nodes
    within the selection will become the current location. If the address of the current location
    is not part of any node within the graph, the red arrow will not be visible.</P>

    <P align="left">When the option <B><A href="#Show_Location_in_Graph">Graph<IMG border="0"
    src="../../shared/arrow.gif"> Show Location</A></B> is turned on, the graph will re-orient
    itself to insure that the red location arrow is always visible.</P>

    <P align="left">Clicking on a node in the graph display causes the
    current address location within Ghidra to change to the minimum address represented by the
    graph node.</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <H2>Graph Representation</H2>

    <P>By Default, the graphs use the following icons and colors to represent the nodes and edges.</P>
