Ghidra server startup parameters.
Command line parameters: [-ip###.###.###.###] [-p#] [-a#] [-d<ntDomain>] [-e<days>] [-u] [-n] <repository_path>
 
   -ip###.###.###.### : ip address to bound to (by default, uses IP address bound to hostname)  
 	
   -p# : base TCP port to be used (default: 13100) [see Note 1]
   
   -a# : an optional authentication mode where # is a value 0 or 2
         0 - Private user password
         2 - PKI Authentication
 
   -anonymous : enables anonymous repository access (see svrREADME.html for details)
 
   -ssh : enables SSH authentication for headless clients

   -e<days> : specifies default password expiration time in days (-a0 mode only, default is 1-day)

   -u   : enable users to be prompted for user ID (does not apply to -a2 PKI mode)

   -n   : enable reverse name lookup for IP addresses when logging (requires proper configuration 
          of reverse lookup by your DNS server)

   <repository_path> : directory used to store repositories. This directory must be dedicated to this 
                       Ghidra Server instance and may not contain files or folders not produced
                       by the Ghidra Server or its administrative scripts.
                       Relative paths originate from the installation directory
                       
The following VM arguments may be required:

	-Dghidra.cacerts=<cacerts-path>     (required for PKI mode only)
	
NOTES:
1. The server utilizes a total of 3 consecutive TCP ports starting with the 
   base port (default: 13100).  The wrapper.log can be examined for server 
   console output which will indicate the startup port assignments.
