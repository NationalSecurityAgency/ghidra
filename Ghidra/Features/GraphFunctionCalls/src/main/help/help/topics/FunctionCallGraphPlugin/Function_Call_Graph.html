      	<P>The Function Call Graph Plugin is a simple graph display that shows incoming and 
      	   outgoing calls (as edges) for the function containing the current address, also known as
      	   the <I>Source Function</I>, in the 
      	   Listing.  This display provides some context for how a function is used within the
      	   program.   The functions are organized by <A HREF="#Level">Level</A>.
      	</P>

		<P>
			To show the Function Call Graph provider window, 
			select the <b>Window</b><img border="0" src="../../shared/arrow.gif">
			<b>Function Call Graph</b> option on the tool menu.
		</P>	

		<P>
			The graph of function calls related to the source function being displayed can be
			explored by <A HREF="#Expand_Collapse">adding existing function calls</A>
			 to the initial graph display.
		</P>
					
		<BLOCKQUOTE>		
		<P>
			<IMG src="images/tip.png" border="0">The graph updates itself as you navigate within
			the tool.  To prevent losing graph state (e.g., expanded functions, node locations,
			etc), a small number of graphs will be cached.   For example, if you navigate 
			away from a function and then immediately return, the graph will be restored to 
			its previous state.

	    		<LI><B>Source Function</B>: the function that contains the current address in 
	    		the Listing.   This function is considered the center of the graph, with all
	    		other callers/callees added to the graph at a new level.
	    		<BR>
				<BR>
	    		</LI>
	    		<LI><A NAME="Level"></A><B>Level</B>: Each function node in the graph belongs to a 
	    		level.   The source function is at level 1; the source function's incoming
	    		calls are at level 2; the source function's outgoing calls are also at level 2.
	    		Organizing functions by level allows the user to quickly see how many hops, or
	    		calls, a given function is from the source function.
	    		<BR>
				<BR>
				New levels of calls can be added to the graph by the user.
				<BR>
				<BR>
	    		</LI>
	    		
	    		<LI><B>Direction</B>: Each function node, other than the source function, is
	    		considered to be in one of two directions: In or Out.  All function nodes in 
	    		a given level share the same direction.  So, all nodes that directly call the
	    		source function node are considered to be the <I>In</I> direction; all nodes
	    		directly called by the source function are considered to be the <I>Out</I> 
	    		direction.
	    		<BR>
				<BR>
				When a given node's level is expanded in the graph, the nodes added are based
				upon the selected node's direction:  for <I>In</I> nodes, the newly added nodes
				will be those nodes that <B>call</B> the selected node; for <I>Out</I> nodes, the 
				newly added nodes will be those nodes <B>called by</B> the selected node.

			<H3><A NAME="Expand_Collapse"></A>Show/Hide Edges Action</H3>
			
				<P>
					Within the <I>Function Call Graph</I> you can show and hide function calls
					as desired.  
					Showing additional function calls can be accomplished multiple ways.  From
					any function node, you can select the <I>Expand</I> icon (
					<IMG SRC="Icons.EXPAND_ALL_ICON" />), which appears
					on a node when hovered.   When clicked, this button will toggle related
					function calls: showing them if not already in the graph; hiding them 
					if they are in the graph. 
				</P>
				
				<P>
					Additionally, these same functionality is provided from the popup menu
					actions (i.e., <B>Show/Hide Incoming Edges</B> and </B>Show/Hide Outgoing
					Edges</B>).
				</P>
				
				<BLOCKQUOTE>		
				<P>
					<IMG src="images/note.png" border="0">As new vertices are added to the 
					graph, any <A HREF="#Indirect_Edges">indirect edges</A> will be added to the
					graph.
				</P>
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				
				<P>Note here how new vertices may appear in odd places when expanding (such as
				 when they are already in the graph at a previous level).
				
				<BLOCKQUOTE>		
					<P>
						<IMG src="../../shared/warning.png" border="0">It is important to understand
						that the graph is only a subset of the entire program graph.  This 
						graph does not represent all functions and function calls in the
						program.

				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<BLOCKQUOTE>		
					<P>
						<IMG src="../../shared/warning.png" border="0">Sometimes a function 
						may have too many references to display in the graph.   When this 
						happens, the function node will be a gray color, with the expand icon

			<H3>Show/Hide Level Edges Action</H3>
			
				<P>
					All functions that relate to the <A HREF="#Level">Level</A> of 
					the selected function will be shown, <b>not just calls to the selected 
					function.</b>
				</P>

			<H3><A NAME="Navigation_Incoming"></A>Navigate on Incoming Location Changes</H3>
			
		        <P>
		        This action (<IMG SRC="Icons.NAVIGATE_ON_INCOMING_EVENT_ICON" />), when 
		        toggled on, upon receiving Program Location changes from the tool, will graph
		        the function containing that location.   When toggled off, location changes will
		        not affect the graph. 
		        </P>
		        <P>
		        Having this action on is useful if you wish to quickly see the graph of 
		        different functions as you navigate the program.   Alternatively, having this
		        action off is useful when you wish to explore the program by navigating from 
		        within the graph, say by double-clicking function nodes in the graph.
		        </P>

			<H3><A NAME="Relayout_Graph"></A>Layout Action</H3>
			
		        <P>This action (<IMG SRC="Icons.REFRESH_ICON" />) will relayout the current graph and 
		        	reset the graph to show only the initial nodes.

				function.
