/**
 * This class represents the Multi-Stream Format File used for Windows PDB files.
 *  We have intended to implement to the Microsoft PDB API (source); see the API for truth.
 *  <P>
 *  Derived classes represents the real formats.  The file format represents a kind of
 *  file system within a file and is based upon pages in order to try to optimize
 *  disk I/O and system update.  There was also a mechanism to allow for ping-ponged
 *  commit for file updates.  Our implementation is only used for reading the file
 *  format; it is not intended to write or modify an existing file.  Much work would
 *  need to be done to create a version with those capabilities.
 *  <P>
 * The file format consists of a first page that contains identifying header information
 *  that consists of an ID string, and limited parameters needed for pointing to
 *  directory information and the Free Page Map.  We do not use the latter information.
 *  <P>
 * Note that the API (source) description on indicates that the original tools could
 *  have been built with different parameter sets, which also impacts the page size
 *  and other parameters for the format.  We intended to create a reader that is capable
 *  of reading any of these files.
 *  <P>
 * The file header generally contains the following information, but their sizes on disk
 *  depends on whether this is a file of the older or newer format.  Generally, the fields follow:
 * <PRE>
 *      Field          Description      Size on Disk Old   Size on Disk New   Java Type
 *      ID               ID "string"           42              29               byte[]
 *                         identifying
 *                         old vs. new
 *      ID padding       Padding between        2               3               N/A
 *                         ID and next
 *                         field
 *      Page Size        Power-of-2 page        4               4               int
 *                         size used
 *      Free Page Map    Page Number of         2               4               int
 *                         current free
 *                         page map
 *      Number of Pages  Number of pages        2               4               int
 *                         currently used
 *                         in the file
 *      Serialized       Sequence of page
 *        info about       numbers
 *        directory
 *        stream:
 *         -Directory    Num of bytes          4+4              4               int
 *           Length      + (opt addr field)
 *         -Page number  Page number that      2+2              4
 *                         contains page
 *                         numbers for the
 *                         stream; see note
 *                         below regarding new!
 * </PRE>
 * The file directory is stored in stream 0, which has its information persisted in
 *  the header as described above.  However, for the newest format, the page (pointed
 *  to in the header) for the directory stream has an extra level of indirection.  The
 *  page contains page numbers, whose pages contain contain page numbers for the
 *  directory stream.  Note that the page numbers listed on any of these pages have
 *  the following format on disk:
 * <PRE>
 *      Field          Description      Size on Disk Old   Size on Disk New   Java Type
 *      Page Number    Page Number             2+2              4               int
 *                     + (opt addr field)
 * </PRE>
 * The directory stream contain StreamTable information, which is serialized into the
 *  directory stream as follows:
 * <PRE>
 *   numStreams
 *   streamLength[numStreams]
 *   serializedStream[numStreams]
 * </PRE>
 * Note that the StreamTable parsed from the directory stream does not have the most
 *  up-to-date information about stream 0 (the directory stream); the up-to-date
 *  version of stream 0 is what was persisted in the header.  So after the StreamTable
 *  has been deserialized from the directory stream, the stream 0 information in the
 *  StreamTable gets overwritten with the stream 0 that we had already obtained.
