    Plugin</H1>

      <P>The <B>Function Bit Patterns Explorer Plugin</B> is used to discover patterns in the bytes
      around function starts and returns. When analyzing a single program, such patterns can be
      used to discover new functions based on the functions that have already been found.</P>

      <P>The explorer can also be used to analyze a collection of XML files containing the function
      start/return information for a <A href="#xml_directory">collection of binaries</A>. Such
      patterns can be used to guide the <B>Function Start Analyzer</B> during auto-analysis.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>To bring up the explorer, select <I>Window -&gt; Function Bit Patterns Explorer</I> from

        <P>Several parameters control how much data is gathered around each function. When

          <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png" alt="Note" border="0">Recommended Parameters:</P>
          Reasonable starting values for the parameters controlling the number of instructions to
          be gathered are 3, 4, and 5. When setting the number of bytes to gather, it's reasonable
          to choose a value that can hold most of the corresponding instruction sequences. For
          example, suppose you're examining x64 programs and set the number of first instructions
          to gather to 4. A reasonable number of first bytes to gather is 20, which should be
          enough to hold most 4-instruction sequences (even though the maximum length of an
          instruction on x64 is 15 bytes).

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>There are three byte sequence tabs: one for first bytes, one for pre-bytes, and one
            for return bytes. Two types of filters can be applied to byte sequences: <I>length
            filters</I> and <I>context register filters</I>. Length filters are required, but

              <BLOCKQUOTE>
                <P>A length filter requires two pieces of data: a minimum sequence length and a
                prefix/suffix length. The filter filters out all sequences which do not meet the
                minimum length constraint. For each sequence that does meet the constraint, it
                takes either a prefix or a suffix of a appropriate length (suffixes are specified
                as a negative number in the input dialog for the filter data).</P>

              <P>After applying such a filter, there will be a table containing bytes sequences,

            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>Similar to byte sequences, there are three instructions sequence tabs, containing
              first instructions, pre instructions, and return instructions, respective. These
              sequences are sorted into a tree. Note that the length of an instruction is taken
              into account. For example, sequences which begin with a one-byte <I>PUSH</I>
              instruction will go through a different path in the tree than sequences with begin
              with a two-byte <I>PUSH</I> instruction. There are two optional filters which you can
              apply to instruction sequences:</P>

              modulus. The number in row <I>i</I> is the number of functions whose addresses modulo
              the alignment modulus is equal to <I>i</I>. This allows you to determine whether
              function starts are aligned within the program (for example, on x64, compilers will
              frequently 16-byte align function starts at higher optimization levels). If you know
              that functions are aligned along a certain boundary, you don't have to search for
              function starts in the non-aligned bytes.</P>

              clipboard, there are two types of patterns: <B>PRE</B> and <B>POST</B>. PRE patterns
              correspond to patterns that occur before the start of a function. Patterns from
              pre-byte and pre-instructions sequences are considered PRE patterns, as are patterns
              from return byte and return instruction sequences (the idea being that the return is
              followed by the start of another function). Patterns from first byte and first
              instruction sequences are considered POST patterns.</P>

                right-clicking, and performing the "Evaluate Selected Patterns" action. This will
                search for the patterns in the current program (if there are both PRE and POST
                patterns, they will be combined). A table will pop up which displays all of the
                matches, information about each match, and aggregated information about all of the

                  Start Analyzer</B> reads in a pattern file, it makes a set patterns. This set
                  consists of each PRE pattern concatenated with each POST pattern for which the

            <P>A <B>Closed Sequential Pattern</B> is a pattern such that no proper super-pattern
            occurs more frequently in the sequences that you're analyzing. For example, suppose the

            (at least) ten times. We'd like to avoid a combinatorial explosion of patterns;
            restricting to closed patterns ensures that any sub-patterns which are listed are
