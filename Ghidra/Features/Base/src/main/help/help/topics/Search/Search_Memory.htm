      <H1>Search Memory</H1>

      <P>The memory search feature locates sequences of bytes in program memory. The search is
      based on user entered values which can be specified in a variety of formats such as hex,
      binary, string, and decimal values. The hex and binary formats support "wildcards" which can
      match any bit or nibbles depending on the format. String search also supports the use of <A
      href="Search_Formats.htm#RegularExpressions">regular expression</A> searches.</P>

      <P>To create a new memory search window, select <B>Search</B> <IMG alt="" border="0" src=
      "help/shared/arrow.gif"><B>Memory</B> from the main tool menu or use the default keybinding
      "S".</P>
		<P><IMG alt="" border="0" src="help/shared/tip.png">By default, search windows and their
		tabs display "Search Memory:" followed by the search string and the program name. This
		can be changed by right-clicking on the title or table to change its name. (This is true
		for all transient windows.)</P>

      <H2>Memory Search Window</H2>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The Memory Search Window provides controls and options for entering search values and
        and a table for displaying the search results. It supports both bulk searching and
        incremental searching forwards and backwards. Also, users can perform additional searches
        and combine those results with the existing results using set operations. The window also
        has a "scan" feature which will re-examine the bytes of the current results set, looking
        for memory changes at those locations (this is most useful when debugging). Scanning has an
        option for reducing the results to those that either changed, didn't change, were
        incremented, or were decremented.</P>

        <H3>Search Controls</H3>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>At the top of the window as shown above, there are several GUI elements for initializing and
          executing a memory byte search. These controls can be closed from the view after a search
          to give more space to view results using the <IMG alt="" border="0"
          src="icon.base.mem.search.panel.search"> toolbar button.</P>

          <H4>Search Format Field:</H4>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>This is a drop-down list of formats whose selected format determines how to
            interpret the text in the <I>Search Input Field</I>. The format will convert the user's
            input into a sequence of bytes (and possibly masks). Details on each format are
            described in the <A href="Search_Formats.htm"><I>Search Formats</I></A> section.</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <H4>Search Input Field:</H4>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>Next to the <I>Search Format</I> drop-down, there is a text field where users can
            enter one or more values to be searched. This field performs validation depending on
            the active format. For example, when the format is <I>Hex</I>, users can only enter
            hexadecimal values.</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <H4>Previous Search Drop Down:</H4>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>At the end of the input field, there is a drop-down list of previous searches.
            Selecting one of these will populate the input field with that previous search input,
            as well as the relevant settings that were used in that search such as the search
            format.</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <H4>Search Button:</H4>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>Pressing the search button will initiate a search. When the results table is empty,
            the only choice is to do an initial search. If there are current results showing in the
            table, a drop-down will appear at the back of the button, allowing the user to combine
            new search results with the existing results using set operations. See the 
            <A href="#Combining_Searches"><I>Combining Searches</I></A> section
            below for more details.</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <H4>Byte Sequence Field:</H4>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>This field is used to show the user the bytes sequence that will be search for based
            on the format and the user input entered. Hovering on this field will also display the
            masks that will be used (if applicable).</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <H4>Selection Only Checkbox:</H4>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>If there is a current selection, then this checkbox will be enabled and provide the
            user with the option to restrict the search to only the selected addresses. Note that
            there is an action that controls whether this option will be selected automatically if
            a selection exists.</P>

        <H3>Scan Controls</H3>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>The scan controls are used to re-examine search results, looking for values that have
          changed since the search was initiated. This is primary useful when debugging. The
          scan controls are not showing by default. Pressing the <IMG alt="" border="0"
          src="icon.base.mem.search.panel.scan"> toolbar button will show the scan panel just
          above the results table.</P>

          <H4>Scan Values Button:</H4>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>This button initiates a scan of the byte values in all the matches in the results
            table. Depending on the selected scan option, the set of matches in the table may be
            reduced based on the values that changed.</P>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>One of the following buttons can be selected and they determine how the set of
            current matches should be reduced based on changed values.</P>

            <UL>
              <LI><B>Equals</B> This option will keep all matches whose values haven't changed and
              remove any matches whose bytes have changed.</LI>

              <LI><B>Not Equals</B> This option will keep all matches whose values have changed and
              will remove any matches whose bytes have not changed.</LI>

              <LI><B>Increased</B> This option will keep all matches whose values have increased
              and will remove any matches whose values decreased or stayed the same.</LI>

              <LI><B>Decreased</B> This option will keep all matches whose values have decreased
              and will remove any matches whose values increased or stayed the same.</LI>
            </UL>

            <P><IMG alt="" border="0" src="help/shared/tip.png">The <I>Increased</I> or
            <I>Decreased</I> options really only make sense for matches that represent numerical
            values such as integers or floats. In other cases it makes the determination based on
            the first byte in the sequence that changed, as if they were a sequence of 1 byte
            unsigned values.</P>

            <P><IMG alt="" border="0" src="help/shared/tip.png">Another way to see changed bytes is

        values of 3. The sets are mutually exclusive, so the intersection would be empty.
        Explaining how to take advantage of these options is beyond the scope of this document.</P>

      <H2>Search Forward/Backwards Using Global Actions</H2>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Once at least one search has been executed using the <A href=
        "#Memory_Search_Window"><I>Memory Search Window</I></A>, the search can be repeated in an
        incremental fashion outside a search window using global actions in the main tool menu or
        their assigned default keybindings.</P>

        <H3>Search Memory Forwards:</H3>

        <P>This action will use the input data and settings from the last memory search and begin
        searching forwards in memory starting at the cursor location in the associated Listing
        display. If a match is found, the cursor in the Listing will be placed on the found match
        location. To execute this action, select <B>Search</B> <IMG alt="" border="0" src=
        "help/shared/arrow.gif"><B>Search Memory Forwards</B> from the main tool menu or press
        <B>F3</B> (the default keybinding.)</P>

        <H3>Search Memory Backwards:</H3>

        <P>This action will use the input data and settings from the last memory search and begin
        searching backwards in memory starting at the cursor location in the associated Listing
        display. If a match is found, the cursor in the Listing will be placed on the found match
        location. To execute this action, select <B>Search</B> <IMG alt="" border="0" src=

      <H2>Highlight Search Options</H2>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>You can control how the bytes found in the search be highlighted in the Code Browser by
        selecting the <I>Highlight Search Results</I> checkbox on the Search Options panel. To view
        the Search Options, select <B>Edit</B><IMG alt="" border="0" src="help/shared/arrow.gif">
        <B>Tool Options...</B> from the tool menu, then select the <I>Search</I> node in the
        Options tree in the Options dialog. You can also change the highlight color. Click on the
        color bar next to <I>Highlight Color</I> to bring up a color chooser. Choose the new color,
        click on the <B>OK</B> button. Apply your changes by clicking on the <B>OK</B> or
        <B>Apply</B> button on the Options dialog.&nbsp;</P>

          <P><IMG alt="" border="0" src="help/shared/note.png"> Highlights are displayed for the
          last search that you did. For example, if you bring up the Search Program Text dialog and
          search for text, that string now becomes the new highlight string. Similarly, if you
          invoke <A href="help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm#cursorTextHighlight">cursor
          text highlighting</A>, that becomes the new highlight string.</P>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

        <P>Highlights are removed when you close the search window.</P>
