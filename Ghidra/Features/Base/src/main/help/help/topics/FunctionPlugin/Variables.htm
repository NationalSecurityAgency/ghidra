    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The following function attributes affect disassembly and semantic analysis and may be set
      via the <A href="Variables.htm#Edit_Function">Edit Function</A> dialog.</P>
      
      <H3>Custom Storage</H3>
      
      <P>The <I>Custom Storage</I> option, if enabled, provides the ability to 
      explicitly specify return/parameter storage.  By default, storage will be dynamically 
      computed based upon calling convention and return/parameter data types.  When dynamic 
      storage is computed, hidden "auto-parameters" may be injected as well as the use of 
      "forced-indirect" storage.

      <H3>Inline</H3>

      <P>Any <I>Inline</I> function called by another function may be treated as inline code
      instead of a function call during analysis.</P>

      <H3>No Return</H3>

      <P>While a typical function call is always assumed to return and continue flowing to the next
      instruction, marking a function as <I>No Return</I> forces an implied return immediately
      following a call to such a function. Depending upon the state of disassembly, marking a
      function as <I>No Return</I> may help to prevent a call to such a function from falling-thru
      to the next instruction during disassembly. If disassembly has already been done and the
      fall-thru has been improperly disassembled, the <A href=
      "../ClearPlugin/Clear.htm#Clear_Flow_and_Repair">Clear Flow and Repair</A> action
      may be used to cleanup the bad fall-through.</P>

      <H3>Varargs</H3>

      <P>Designated by a trailing '...' in the function signature, indicates that a variable number
      of parameters is allowed. Common C functions which employ Varargs are <I>printf</I> and
      <I>scanf</I>.</P>

      <H3>Call-Fixup</H3>

      <P>A function may be tagged with a predefined <I>Call-Fixup</I> which can be used to
      alter/simplify the semantic effect of calling such a function. The available set of
      predefined call-fixups are defined within the compiler specification (*.cspec file)
      associated with a program. This feature is typically used when the effects of calling a
      well-known function need to be simplified so that the caller can be more easily analyzed
      and/or understood.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    
    <H2>Variables</H2>
    
    <P>There are two classes of function variables: Parameters and Local Variables.  The term Parameter 
    also includes the Function return value which has an associated data type and storage but has no 
    ordinal. </P>

    <P>Many processors use a stack as part of their calling conventions and/or for local variable storage. 
    In some cases, the return address is pushed onto the stack during the call operation. Any references to the
    stack (e.g., references and variable storage) are relative to the stack pointer when the function is entered. For a negative growing
    stack (like the X86 processor), the stack would look something like this:</P>

    <P>Structures, Unions, and Arrays can be used to define variables as well as the built in
    primitive <A href="../DataPlugin/Data.htm#DataTypes">data types</A>.&nbsp; To define
    structures, see <A href="../DataTypeEditors/StructureEditor.htm">Data Structure
    Editor</A></P> 
    
    <H3>Parameters (includes Function Return)</H3>
    
    <P>Storage for return/parameters can be computed dynamically based upon 
    the associated calling convention and data types (i.e., complete function signature).  The ability
    to properly compute the correct storage is limited by the current capabilities of the 
    function prototype models and Decompiler within Ghidra.  In some cases it will be necessary to enable 
    Custom Storage for a function and specify the correct storage locations for the return/parameters 
    including the ability to join multiple storage elements (i.e., varnodes) for a single parameter.</P>
    
    <P>When parameter storage is determined dynamically, the calling convention may dictate the 
    use of hidden parameters which we refer to as "<i>auto-parameters</i>" <b>(auto)</b>.
    In addition, the "<i>forced-indirect</i>" <b>(ptr)</b> condition may be imposed on
    parameters when large data is forced to be passed by reference.  When either of these
    is in use for the return or parameters, the <b>(auto)</b> or <b>(ptr)</b> designation
    will appear with the storage location displayed for each parameter.  The parameter names <b>'this'</b>
    and <b>'__return_storage_ptr__'</b> are reserved for the two supported auto-parameter cases.
    The <b>'this'</b> <i>auto-parameter</i> is imposed by the <i>__thiscall</i> calling convention,
    while <i>forced-indirect</i> is imposed by certain calling conventions which limit the maximum size
    of any parameter passed by value.  If <i>forced-indirect</i> is imposed on the return storage, the 
    <b>'__return_storage_ptr__'</b> <i>auto-parameter</i> will be imposed to allow the function caller
    to specify a pointer to the full return storage data location.  When using custom storage,
    it is assumed any <i>auto-parameters</i> will be explicitly defined as normal parameters if applicable.  
    Within the Program API, <i>auto-parameters</i> may not be directly manipulated and are immutable.
    </P>
    
    <P>The <A href="#Edit_Function">Function Editor</A> is the most affective means of modifying the 
    function signature either via the Code Browser listing or within the Decompiler</P>
    
    <H3>Local Variables</H3>
    
    <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <P><I>&nbsp;<IMG src="../../shared/note.png">Currently, there is no specific user interface
      action for creating Local Variables.&nbsp; Stack and register variables will be created
      automatically when a suitable stack or register reference is created via the user
      interface.&nbsp; Additionally, the Decompiler's commit actions will create Local Variables as
      needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> <I>They can also be created programmatically.</I></P>
    </DIV>
    
    <P>In addition to register and stack locations, Local Variables
    also have the ability to be defined by the Decompiler to reflect temporary storage identified 
    by a hash value.  Please note that these hash type variables can sometimes not work as expected within the 
    Decompiler.  In addition, the scope of a local register variable is determined by its <i>first-use-offset</i>
    which reflects the instruction offset relative to the function entry point at which the variable
    is first written.  The variable will remain in scope from that point forward until another
    local variable comes into scope for the same storage location. Local stack variables assume a 
    <i>first-use-offset</i> of zero (0).</P>
