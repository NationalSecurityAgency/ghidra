    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Most trees and tables in Ghidra support filtering and have a text filter located at the
      bottom of the tree or table.   Tables also support the concept of 
      <A HREF="#Column_Filters">Column Filters</A> described below. 
      </P>
      
      <P>Below is an example from the Data Type Manager. The filter is
      currently set to "Starts With", but you can select a different filter strategy.</P>

      <CENTER>
        <IMG alt="" src="images/Filter.png" border="0">
      </CENTER>

      <P>The button to the right of the filter will bring up the <A href="#Filter_Options">Filter
      Options Dialog</A>. Its icon indicates the current <A href="#Filter_Strategy">Filter
      Strategy</A>.</P>

      <P>Ghidra will remember the filter state for each tree or table. So, when you re-launch
      Ghidra, all your trees and tables will have the filter state set as it was when you last
      exited Ghidra.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><IMG alt="" src="help/shared/note.png"> Some trees use more than the node's name for
        filter purposes. So, it may appear that the filter is matching more than it should, when
        actually it is also using some other related text for the match, such as a node
        description.</P>

              Tree nodes will match if its name contains the text in the filter text field. Table

            <TD nowrap valign="top">Regular Expression</TD>

            <TD>Tree nodes will match if the regular expression in the filter matches the name of
            the node. Table rows will match if any of the columns matches the regular expression.
            See <A href="help/topics/Search/Regular_Expressions.htm#Regex_Syntax">regular
            expression</A> for help. Note that the regular expression will match if the pattern it
            represents is <B>contained</B> in the tree node name or table column. If you want to
            match the beginning or end (i.e starts with or ends with), you must include the special
            "starts with" (^) or "ends with" ($) regular expression character syntax. For example,
            the regular expression "bob" will match "bobby", "hey bobby", and "bob", but the
            regular expression "^bob" will match "bobby" and "bob", and "^bob$" will only match
            "bob".  The <B>Case Sensitive</B> check box is disabled for regular expressions, and
            the default matching mode is exact case matching.  Case insensitive matching can be
            enabled by including the "(?i)" embedded flag at the beginning of your filter.  For
            example, the regular expression "(?i)bob" will match items with "Bob", "bob", and
            "BOB".

      <H3>Case Sensitive</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Selecting the case sensitive checkbox will cause the filter to be case sensitive when
        matching the text in the filter text field against the nodes or table rows. NOTE: This
        option has no effect when the "Regular Expression" strategy is selected.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Allow Globbing</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Selecting the allow globbing checkbox will cause the filter to interpret the globbing
        chars "*" and "?" as wildcards. The "*" char will match any number of characters while the
        "?" character will match a single character. For example "ab*g" will match "abxg" and
        "abxxg" and so on. The text "ab?g" will match "abxg" but not "abxxg". NOTE: This option has
        no effect when the "Regular Expression" strategy is selected.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Invert Filter</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Selecting the Invert Filter checkbox will cause the filter to only include those tree nodes
        or table rows that <B>DO NOT</B> meet the filter text criteria. In other words, "contains"
        becomes "does not contain". This negation happens after all other filtering tests have been
        performed, including multi-term matching.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

	  <H3>Use Path</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Selecting the Use Path checkbox will cause the filter to prepend each node's path 
        to its text being used to filter.  This allows users to filter on a node's path.  When 
        this box is unselected, only the default node filter information is used, typically the
        nodes name.</P>
        
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/tip.png" alt="">The format of a node path looks

      <H3>Enable Multi-Term Filtering<A name="Multiple_Terms" id="Multiple_Terms"></A></H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Often it is useful to filter the contents of a tree or table according to multiple
        terms. The options here specify how a more complex filter expression is interpreted and
        evaluated. If the text is split, the Filter Strategy and associated options -- case
        sensitivity, globbing, and inversion -- are applied to each term.</P>

        <P><IMG alt="" src="help/shared/note.png"> When 'Regular Expression' is selected as the
        filter strategy, these options are disabled. Regular expressions are flexible enough to
        match multiple terms and may contain many of the characters otherwise used for convenient
        text splitting.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Delimiter<A name="Spliting_Strategy" id="Spliting_Strategy"></A></H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>How terms are split apart is governed by two significant factors -- user preference, and
        the data being processed. If the data in the tree or table contains spaces and commas,
        these could make poor choices for separating filter terms -- the semicolon or pipe would
        likely be more appropriate choices.</P>

        <P>Ghidra defaults to a comma separator for multiple terms; you may select a different
        delimiter character from the following:<BR>
        </P>

        <P style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:#CCCCCC; background-color:#EEEEEE">
        [space] ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * - _ + = | : ; , .</P>

        <P>Whitespace preceding and trailing the delimiter is automatically removed.</P>

        <P>In situations were the delimiter appears in your filter term, wrap the term in
        double-quotes to protect the expression. For example, '<CODE>bob | "cat | dog" |
        jane</CODE>' will be split (assume the '<CODE>|</CODE>' delimiter) into three terms --
        <CODE>bob</CODE>, <CODE>cat | dog</CODE>, and <CODE>jane</CODE>. (Note that both the
        delimiter character and the spaces in the '<CODE>cat | dog</CODE>' term persists; the
        entire quoted string was parsed as a string literal.) Typically, this situation can be
        avoided by selecting a more appropriate delimiter that doesn't collide with values in the
        tree or table row.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Evaluation Mode<A name="Evaluation_Mode" id="Evaluation_Mode"></A></H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>When filtering multiple terms, it may be useful to specify a higher-level acceptance
        model. The Filter Evaluation Mode specification allows a user to specify how the multiple
        filters are combined into a more robust expression. Most frequently, you'll likely be
        looking for data that matches "X or Y" -- select '<CODE>OR</CODE>' in this case, and enter
        values X and Y according to the current splitting strategy ("X Y", "X;Y", "X|Y", etc.).
        Again, the evaluation for whether a piece of data matches X or Y is determined by the <A
        href="#Filter_Strategy">Filter Strategy</A>.<BR>
         However, if you're looking for data that matches all the terms of your filter, select the
        '<CODE>AND</CODE>' evaluation mode. Each filter for values X and Y must accept the data for
        overall acceptance by the filter.</P>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><IMG alt="" src="help/shared/note.yellow.png"> Using delimiters that otherwise have a
          logical definition -- '<CODE>+</CODE>', or '<CODE>|</CODE>', for example -- have
          <I>no</I> semantic value in this application; they are simply tokens for input string
          processing.</P>
