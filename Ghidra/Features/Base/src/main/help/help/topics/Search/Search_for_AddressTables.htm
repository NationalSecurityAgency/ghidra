    the entire program or be limited to a selection. The results are presented in list form,
    allowing the user to make tables and disassemble the addresses in those tables.</P>

    <H3>Making Address Tables</H3>

      <P>To make an address table,</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>Select one or more rows in the <B>Possible Address Tables</B> table.</LI>

        <LI>Select the <B>Auto Label</B> checkbox to automatically create labels at the beginning
        of each address table that was created, at all of the addresses contained in those tables,
        and at the top of the indexes to the tables if there are any.</LI>

        <LI>
          If necessary, enter an offset (number of addresses to be skipped) to be added to the
          starting address(es) (offset multiplied by 4, the address size). 

          <UL>
            <LI>For one address table, the entered offset cannot be greater than one less than the
            length of the possible table.</LI>

            <LI>For multiple address tables, the offset value cannot be greater than one less than
            the length of the smallest selected table.</LI>

            <LI>The field next to <I>Offset</I> shows the adjusted start address for the table;
            this field cannot be edited. It is empty for multiple table selections.</LI>
          </UL>
        </LI>

        <LI>Select the <B>Make Table</B> button.</LI>

        <LI>An address table gets created at the location you chose, containing defined addresses
        which now point to the address created. These addresses now contain XREFs to the table
        entries. If an index to the table exists immediately after the table, it will get created
        as an array of bytes, as well.</LI>

      <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/warning.png">A warning dialog is
      displayed if address tables could not be created due to a collision with existing data at
