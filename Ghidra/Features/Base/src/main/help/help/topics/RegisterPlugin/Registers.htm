    <H1>Register Values</H1>

    <P>Each program has a set of registers that is determined by the program's <I>language.</I>
    When a program is actually running, the registers contain values that make up the <I>processor
    state</I> at any given instant. Since Ghidra programs represent a <I>static</I> view (i.e. not
    running), there is no "instant" that can be examined to see register values. The best
    approximation is to assign registers values at addresses. This is useful if the register value
    can be determined to be constant anytime the instruction at that address is executed.</P>

    <P>For example, if an instruction at address 0x1000 is "mov ax,20", then it might be possible
    to assume that the value of register ax will be 20 for the next several instructions (assuming
    there are no "jumps" into that code).</P>

    <P>Setting register values can sometimes be the critical link for successfully performing
    various types of analysis or even getting the correct disassembly. For example, some processors
    have a "mode" that is stored in some register. Depending on the mode, the processor may have
    completely different instruction sets. To disassemble properly, the mode register must be set
    at the address where the disassembly begins.</P>

      <P>The <I>Register Manager</I> displays the assigned values of registers at addresses within

      <P>The left side of the Register Manager is a tree containing all the registers defined for
      the program's language. &nbsp;If the registers have been grouped into categories by the
      language, those registers will appear under a folder with that group name. &nbsp;Registers
      that break down into smaller registers are marked with the <IMG src=
      "images/registerGroup.png"> icon. &nbsp;These nodes can be further opened to reveal their
      component registers. &nbsp;For example, EAX can be opened to show AX, which can then be
      opened to show AL and AH. &nbsp;Registers that don't have sub pieces use the&nbsp;<IMG src=
      "images/registerIcon.png"> icon. &nbsp;The filter text field, located under the register tree
      can be used to quickly find any register. &nbsp;As you begin to type the name of a register,
      the tree will shrink eliminating any registers that don't contain the filter text.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>The right side of the Register Manager is a table that displays ranges of addresses that
      have assigned values for whichever register is selected in the register tree.
      &nbsp;Initially, the table only contains values that have been explicitly associated with the
      selected register and addresses. &nbsp;There is an option in the drop down menu that will
      cause the table to also show <I>default</I> values for a register. &nbsp;Default values are
      assigned by the language and usually only apply to context registers.<BR>

            <P>Using the dialog, you can adjust the start or end address and/or change the value
            associated with the range. &nbsp;If you change the start or end address such that the
            range is smaller, then value associations for address range that was trucated is
            effectively cleared. For example, in the dialog shown above, if you change the end
            address to 01001b47 and change the value to 111, then addresses 01001b33 to 01001b47
            will have the value 111 and address 01001b48 will have no value. When entering a
            new start or end address, you can also enter an
