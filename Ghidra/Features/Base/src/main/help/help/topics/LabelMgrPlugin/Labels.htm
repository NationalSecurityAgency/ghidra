    <H1>Labels</H1>

    <P>A label is a name associated with an address. Labels are used to make code easier to read.
    For example, instead of "call 0x103f2d", the instruction might read "call printf". The name
    "printf" has been associated with the address "0x103f2d". In other words, the address
    "0x103f2d" has been labeled printf.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>All labels have an assigned symbol name which has either explicitly been established or a
      default generated name. When assigning a label name (or any other namespace or symbol name)
      the following naming restrictions apply:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI><B>Reserved Dynamic Name Pattern</B> - certain dynamic name patterns are reserved for
        Ghidra use and may not be explicitly set. A dynamic pattern generally consists of a default
        prefix (<I>SUB_, LAB_, DAT_, UNK_, EXT_, FUN_, OFF_</I>) followed by an address (e.g.,
        <I>LAB_01234567</I>).</LI>

        <LI><B>Space and Non-printable Characters Not Allowed</B> - a blank space character or
        other non-printable ASCII character (e.g., backspace, linefeed, etc.) are not permitted
        within a name</LI>

        <LI><B>Length Limit of 2000</B> - the name length may not exceed 2000 characters/bytes</LI>
      </UL>

      <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png" alt="Note:"> In addition to the above restrictions, the
      use of '::' within a label name may cause problems with certain name edit dialogs which may
      use this as a namespace separator.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Some labels are automatically generated during disassembly. They use a standard naming
      convention to derive the symbolic name from the address. The current convention is to use a
      prefix that gives some information about what is at the address, followed by the address. For
      example, the automatic label generated for address "0x01234" would be "LAB_01234" if there is
      code at that address. If there was a data item at that address, the label would be
      "DAT_01234". Labels with auto-generated names are known as <I>default</I> labels. The
      importer, auto-analysis, or the user can also create labels (or rename default labels) using
      more meaningful names.<BR>
      Default label prefixes can be any of the following:</P>

      label "Entry".) Shared libraries (DLLs) usually have many entry points, one for each function
      in the library. Since the "entry point" property is really associated with an address and not
      a particular label, all labels at an address share this property.</LI>
