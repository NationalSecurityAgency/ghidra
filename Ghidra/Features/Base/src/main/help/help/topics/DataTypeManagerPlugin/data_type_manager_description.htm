              <TD>The built-in data types are implemented directly in Java and are used for the

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Data type archives are used to bundle and share data types between programs, projects, and
      users. There are two different types of user created archives: File data type archives and
      Project data type archives. Data type archives can be accessed within the 
      <I>Data Type Manager</I> window. When a data type archive is open, it
      is displayed as a node in the <I>Data Type Manager</I>
      tree. Archives can be opened by the user or automatically when a program is opened which
      references that archive. Data type archives can be <A href="#open_for_editing">open for
      modification</A> or as read-only. Within the <I>Data Type Manager</I> window there are
      actions for opening, closing, renaming, and making archives modifiable.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3>Built-In Data Type Archive <IMG alt="" src="images/closedBookBrown.png"><BR>
    </H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The "Built-in" archive is a special archive that is always available in the 
      <I>Data Type Manager</I> window. It provides access to all of Ghidra's
      "Built-in" data types. "Built-in" types are discovered by searching through Ghidra's class
      path.</P>
    
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><IMG src="help/shared/note.png" alt="">In the unlikely event that new data type class files
    or jar files are added while Ghidra is running, there is a refresh action which will find and

    </H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>File data type archives (or simply: file archives) store data types in files and have
      ".gdt" filename extensions. They can be located anywhere in the filesystem. File archives can
      be open by more than one user at the same time (assuming it is located on a shared
      filesystem), but only one of those users can have it open for modification.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3><A name="ProjectDataTypeArchive"></A>Project Data Type Archive <IMG alt="" src=
    "images/closedBookBlue.png"><BR>
    </H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Project data type archives (or simply: project archives) store data types in Ghidra
      project database directories, along with the programs for that project. The <A href=
      "../FrontEndPlugin/Ghidra_Front_end.htm">Ghidra Project Window</A> will display project
      archives in the same tree structure used to show the programs in the project. Project
      archives can be versioned and shared in a multi-user environment just like programs. They use
      the same "check-in/checkout" semantics for updating and sharing changes.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3>Data Types in a Program <IMG alt="" src="images/closedBookRed.png"><BR>
    </H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Besides being stored in archives, data types are also stored inside programs.</P>

      <P><IMG src="help/shared/note.png" alt="">Any data type used in a program must be stored in
      that program even if it originally came from an archive.</P>

      <P>Because of this, the "same" data types can live in more than one archive or program and
      can be modified in different ways in each place where it lives. Prior to Ghidra 4.3, keeping
      data types consistent between archives and programs was a problem because there was no way to
      maintain an association, except by location and name, which was difficult due to potential
      conflicts. Now additional information such as source archive, unique ID and various change
      times are maintained to facilitate keeping data types consistent across archives and
      programs.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3><A name="categories"></A>Categories <IMG alt="" src="images/closedFolder.png"><BR>
    </H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Within a program or data type archive, data types can be organized using categories.
      Categories are like folders in a filesystem and allow data types to be organized into a
      hierarchical structure. Categories are ignored for purposes of <A href="#synchronizing">data
      type synchronization</A>. In other words, the same data type might be in a category named
      "aaa" in an archive and be in a category named "bbb" in the program. As far as Ghidra is
      concerned, the different category does not constitute a data type difference.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3>Data Type Manager Tree</H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The <I>Data Type Manager</I> window organizes data types
      using a tree structure. At the first level below the tree root, a node will exist for each
      open archive and the "Built-in" archive. If a program is open, a node will also exist at this
      level representing the program. In many ways, an open program behaves like a data type
      archive.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3>Applying Data Types</H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The primary purpose of a data type is to apply it to various elements in a program. Data
      types can be applied to memory locations to provide interpretations of the bytes at those
      locations. They can also be used to describe function parameters and local variables.</P>

      <P>One way to apply data types is to drag them from an archive and drop them on an element in
      the program <A href="../CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm#Code_Browser">Listing</A>. This
      action will cause a copy of the data type to be added to the program and then a reference to
      the copy will be used to annotate the program element. There are other ways of applying data
      types to a program and they are described in more detail <A href=
      "#applying_datatypes">later</A>.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3>Resolving Data Types</H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>When a data type from an archive is applied to a program, a copy of that data type is
      created in the program. The process of making that copy is called <I>resolving</I>. This is a
      complicated process because data types can contain or reference other data types, possibly in
      a circular fashion (via pointers). These referred data types may or may not already exist in
      the program and the resolving process must account for this. Sometimes, a data type might
      already exist with the same name as the <I>resolving</I> data type. Even if the conflicting
      data type is equivalent, Ghidra may not be able to determine if the existing data type is
      really meant to be the same as the <I>resolving</I> data type. Generally, such conflicts are
      resolved by renaming the new or moved type by appending ".conflict" to its name. For many of
      the data type actions initiated from the Data Type tree window, the specific conflict
      resolution is determined by the current <A href="data_type_manager_window.html#conflict_mode">Data Type Conflict Mode</A>.
      In the end, applying a single data type to a program can cause many new data types to be
      added to the program.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H3><A name="source_archive"></A>Source Archive</H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Whenever data types are resolved from an archive to a program or another archive, the
      default behavior is to tag the copied data types with information about the archive from
      which the data types originated. So each archive or program maintains a list of source
      archives from which it has associated data types. Ghidra uses the term <I>Source Archive</I>
      as a descriptor that identifies a file or project data type archive where a data type
      originated. Whenever a program is opened, the <I>Data Type Manager</I> gets a list of source
      archives from the program and automatically opens the corresponding data type archives if it
      can find them. Using information stored in the source archive object along with information
      from the actual archive and the change time on a data type, Ghidra can determine if data
      types are <I>out-of-sync</I> with their corresponding data type in a program or other
      archive.</P>
      <P><IMG src="help/shared/note.png" alt="">
      The data type tree will indicate data types that have a source archive association
      by displaying the name of the source archive in parenthesis after the data type name.</P>

      <H3>Client Archive</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Ghidra uses the term <I>client</I> <I>archive</I> to
        represent the archive that contains a data type taken from a <I><A href=
        "#source_archive">source archive</A></I>. This includes normal data type archives <B>and
        the program</B>.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>When new releases of Ghidra are installed, old datatype archives may be dropped. In some
        cases these old archives may be replaced with a differently named archive. When this
        happens, this popup action can be used on a client archive to update the old source archive
        references. This popup action is only available when such an archive name change has
        occurred. Any programs or other client archives which reference the old archive will have 
        this popup action available to update the source archive name reference.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Committing Changes To Source Archive</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If changes are made to a data type that has an association with a source archive, those
        changes must be applied to the original in the source archive to keep the data types in
        sync. Ghidra uses the term <I>commit</I> to mean propagating changes from a data type back
        to its corresponding data type in the source archive.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Updating Data Types From Source Archive</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If changes are made to a data type in an archive that has associated data types in a
        client archive, those changes can be pushed out to those associations. Ghidra uses the term
        <I>update</I> to mean propagating changes from a data type in a source archive to its
        associated copies in a client archive.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Reverting</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If changes are made to a data type that has an association with a source archive, that
        data type is now different from its source data type. Ghidra uses the term <I>revert</I> to
        throw away the changes and put the data type back to the way it is in the source archive.
        If changes are made in both the referenced data type and the source data type, the
        <I>revert</I> action will not be available because the original state is not known. In this
        case, you must either <A href="#Commit">commit</A>, which will lose the changes in the
        source archive, or <A href="#synchronizing">update</A> losing the changes in the client
        archive. Currently, there is no merge capability.<BR>
         See <A href="#Revert_Data_Type">Reverting Changes</A> for more information.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Synchronizing an Archive</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>When changes are made to data types in either the source archive or client archive, the
        archive is said to be <I>out-of-sync</I>. Ghidra provides a capability known as
        <I>synchronizing</I> to find all the data types that need to be <A href=
        "#Commit_To_Archive">committed</A>, <A href="#Update_From_Archive">updated</A>, or <A href=
        "#Revert_Data_Type">reverted</A> and allow the user to make a decision on each data
        type.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3><A name="file_archive_path"></A>File Archive Path<BR>
      </H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Ghidra maintains a list of directories used to search for file archives. This list is
        known as the archive path. Ghidra provides a dialog for adding, removing, and re-ordering
        the list of these directories. When Ghidra maintains source archive information for a file
        data type archive, it only stores the name of the archive and not the entire file path.
        Storing absolute paths would make the file archive references very brittle when the program
        is shared or moved to another location. By using archive paths, different users can
        maintain copies of the source archives in different locations on their computer and still
        be able to find the archives in their shared programs.<BR>

		<P>By default, data type archives are not assigned an architecture and adopt a default

		as well as alignment and packing behavior.  While data types copied between archives or a program
		with disimilar <I>Data Organizations</I> will generally resolve correctly, unexpected results 
		may sometimes arise (e.g., bit-field packing within structures).  In addition, this situation 
		frequently causes some confusion when viewing and editing data types where the <I>Data 
		Organization</I> differs from the intended target architecture.</P>
		
		<P>With either a file or project data type archive open for editing, a specific architecture
		may be assigned to the archive.  This is done by selecting the open archive node from the
		data type tree, right-click on it and select the <I><B>Set Architecture...</B></I> action.
		This will popup a processor/compiler-specification selection dialog from which a selection
		may be made and the <B>OK</B> button clicked.  A final confirmation dialog will be displayed

          <P>Data types can be copied within an archive or from one archive to another, but the
          behavior of the copy is very different for the two cases. When copying within an archive,
          the behavior is more natural. A copy of the source data type is placed inside the
          destination category. However, copying from one archive to another behaves somewhat
          unusually. In this case, the destination folder is only relevant as to which archive is
          the recipient of the copy. After the copy, the destination archive will contain the
          copied data type. However, any data types contained by the copied data type are also
          copied to exactly the same relative (to the root category node) category paths as the

        <P>Whenever a data type is applied to a program, or dragged to a category under the

        data type is created in the program. Also, an association back to the original data type is
        created. That is the normal case and it is designed to be fairly intuitive. Less intuitive
        is when a data type is originally created in a program and then is shared by dragging a
        copy to an archive. Since programs cannot be the source for a data type, a dialog is
        displayed asking the user if they want an association to be created. If the user answers
        yes, an association is created, but the archive will become the source and the program's
        data type is the one that gets the association. In other words, it appears as if the data
        type were created in the archive and copied to the program.</P>

        <P>On occasion there may be the need to add stipulate additional attributes on a pointer

        Such pointer attributes may only be specified when such a pointer in in the form of a Typedef
        which enables the datatype to preserve these attributes during type resolution and propagation. 
        This includes preservation of such Typedef Settings within a data type archive, and through 
        merge processing, which normal Data Settings do not support.</P>
        
        <P>The Typedef Settings may be modified via the Settings dialog in the same way data type Default Settings 
        are changed for listing Data (see <A href="../DataPlugin/Data.htm#Default_Settings">Changing Default Settings for Data</A>).
        In addition to this popup action on listing Data, the dialog may be displayed from the <I>Data Type Manager</I>

        are only supported as default settings for a typedef and may not be overridden at the component or data level.</A>
        
        <P>The following Pointer-Typedef settings are currently supported:</P>
        <UL>
        <LI><B>Address Space</B> (case-sensitive string) - Allows a specific address space to be associated with a pointer.  
        If an unknown name is used it will be silently ignored. Auto name attribute format: __((space(<i>name</i>))</LI>
        <LI><B>Component Offset</B> (signed value) - Allows a base-relative offset to be specified.  When applied
        to memory an Offset Reference will be generated.  I addition, type analysis may use the offset to identify
        a component relative to the pointer's base-datatype (e.g., structure).  Auto name attribute format: __((offset(<i>signed_value</i>))</LI>
        <LI><B>Offset Mask</B> (64-bit mask) - Allows a bit-mask to be applied to a stored value when computing the 
        absolute memory offset.  This bit-mask will be applied prior to any applied bit-shift.  Auto name attribute format: __((mask(<i>hex_mask</i>))</LI>   
        <LI><B>Offset Shift</B> (-64..0..64) - Allows a bit-shift (left=negative, right=positive) to be applied to a
        stored value when computing the absolute memory offset.  Auto name attribute format: __((shift(<i>bitshift_amount</i>))</LI>
        <LI><B>Pointer Type</B> (<I>default, image-base-relative, relative, file-offset</I>) - allows the overall interpretation of a
        pointer to be specified.  The <I>relative</I> pointer type has limited applicability and is only 
        intended to be applied to pointers stored in memory since their storage location is used in computing 
        the absolute address that the pointer refers to.</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P><IMG src="help/shared/note.png" alt="" border="0">All Typedef Settings must be established on
