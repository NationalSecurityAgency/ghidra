    <h1>Ghidra Bundles</h1> 

    <h2>Dynamic modules</h2> 
    <p> Scripting brings a powerful form of dynamic extensibilty to Ghidra,
    where Java source code is (re)compiled, loaded, and run without exiting
    Ghidra.  When a script grows large or requires external dependencies, it
    might be worth the effort to split up code into <em>modules</em>.</p>

    <p>To support modularity while preserving the dynamic nature of scripts,
    Ghidra uses <a href="https://www.osgi.org">OSGi</a>.  Without delving too
    much into terminology, the key things to know are </p>
    <ol style="padding-left:8em">
      <li>The unit of modularity in OSGi is the <em>bundle</em>.  Bundles are
        <em>mostly independent</em> components with declared imports and exports.
      </li>

      <li>Concretely, a bundle is a Jar file with extra metadata in its
        manifest file that tells the framework what it uses/imports and what it
        provides/exports.
        <br/>
        Bundles are Jars, but Ghidra will automatically compile source
        directories to bundles.  We refer to source directories intended to be
        used in OSGi as <a href="BundleManager.htm#sourceBundles"> <em>source
        bundles</em></a>. Each Ghidra script directory is a seperate
        source bundle.</li>

      <li>Bundles can <em>export</em> Java packages for use by other bundles,
        and packages can have version numbers assigned.</li>

      <li>Bundles can <em>import</em> packages from other bundles, and each
        import can be constrained by version number or range.</li>

      <li>The entire Ghidra API is part of the "system bundle", meaning its packages don't need
        need to be explicitly imported.
      </li>

      <li>A bundle can provide an <em>activator</em> class whose start and stop methods
      are called when the bundle is activated/deactivated.
      </li>

    </ol>


    <h2><a name="sourceBundles"/>Source bundles</h2> 
    <p>When a directory is added to the Bundle Manager, it is treated as a
    <em>source bundle</em>. When enabled, its Java contents are compiled to
    <pre>
        &lt;user home&gt;/.ghidra/.ghidra-&lt;version&gt;/osgi/compiled-bundles/&lt;hash&gt;/
    </pre>
    where <code>&lt;hash&gt;</code> is a hash of the source bundle path.  These compiled artifacts are then loaded
    by the OSGi framework.</p>
    <h3>exploded bundles</h3>
    <p>
    Each such subdirectory of <code>compiled-bundles/</code> is an <em>exploded
      jar</em> --  by compressing it, we get a standard OSGi Jar bundle:</p>
    <pre>
            jar cMf mybundle.jar -C $HOME/.ghidra/.ghidra_&lt;version&gt;/osgi/compiled-bundles/&lt;hash&gt;  .
    </pre>

    <h3><a name="generated_files"/>generated files</h3>
    <p>If there is no manifest in the source directory, Ghidra generates one
    using <a href="https://bnd.bndtools.org/">bndlib</a> so that:
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left:8em">
      <li>Every package is exported unless it contains <code>private</code> or <code>internal</code> in its name.</li>
      <li>Packages listed in <code>@importpackage</code> meta-data are imported from active bundles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: <em>import</em> and <em>export</em> here refer to inter-bundle dependency, see <a href="#inter-bundle-dependency">below</a></p>
    <p>
      If no bundle activator is present, a stub is created and referenced in the generated manifest.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="dependency"/>Dependency</h2> 
    <p>Two types of code dependency are available when developing with OSGi, intra-bundle and
    inter-bundle.</p>


    <h3>intra-bundle (<em>compile time</em>) dependency</h3>
    <p>Classes within a bundle, e.g. source files in a source bundle, can rely one another with
    Java's usual package <code>import</code>.</p> <p>This kind of dependency is resolved at
    compile time -- if a class isn't imported or present, compilation will fail.</p>

    <p>In the following example, <code>IntraBundleExampleScript</code> depends on <code>mylib.MyLibrary</code> without
    any special dependency declaration since they are both defined in the same source bundle,
    <code>my_ghidra_scripts</code>:</p>
    <pre>
    my_ghidra_scripts/mylib/MyLibrary.java:
        package mylib;

        public class MyLibrary {
        	public void doStuff() {
        		// ...
        	}
        }

    my_ghidra_scripts/IntraBundleExampleScript.java
        // Intra-bundle dependency example.
        //@category Examples

        import ghidra.app.script.GhidraScript;
        import mylib.MyLibrary;

        public class IntraBundleExampleScript extends GhidraScript {
        	@Override
        	public void run() throws Exception {
        		new MyLibrary().doStuff();
        	}
        }
    </pre>

    <h3><a name="inter-bundle-dependency" />inter-bundle (<em>run time</em>) dependency</h3>
    <p>To make use of code from <em>other</em> bundles, a bundle must declare its
    dependencies.  When a bundle is activated, the framework attempts to
    <em>resolve</em> its declared dependencies against active bundles.  The
    first match, in the order of bundle activation, will be "wired" to
    the dependent.</p>

    <p>Note: OSGi bundle dependency is very similar to Java 9 modules. The key difference is that
    Java 9 modules provide <em>load time</em> resolution, while OSGi provides <em>run time</em>
    resolution.</p>

    <h4><code>@importpackage</code> in a script</h4>
    <p>Ghidra's <code>@importpacakge</code> meta-data tag provides a convenient way to declare inter-bundle
    dependencies directly in a script. Set the value to a comma separated list of packages
    to import from other bundles.</p>

    <p>In the example below, the class <code>InterBundleExampleScript</code> is implemented in the bundle
    <code>my_ghidra_scripts</code> and uses a class, <code>yourlib.YourLibrary</code>, defined in another bundle,
    <code>your_ghidra_scripts</code>.</p>
    <pre>
    your_ghidra_scripts/yourlib/YourLibrary.java:
        package yourlib;

        public class YourLibrary {
        	public void doOtherStuff() {
        		// ...
        	}
        }


    my_ghidra_scripts/InterBundleExampleScript.java
        // Inter-bundle dependency example.
        //@category Examples
        //@importpackage yourlib

        import ghidra.app.script.GhidraScript;
        import yourlib.YourLibrary;

        public class InterBundleExampleScript extends GhidraScript {
        	@Override
        	public void run() throws Exception {
        		new YourLibrary().doOtherStuff();
        	}
        }
    </pre>

    <h4><code>Import-Package</code> in the manifest</h4>
    <p>The underlying OSGi mechanism for declaring inter-bundle dependency is via the manifest.</p>

    <p>You can find detailed descriptions of manifest attributes used by OSGi, like <code>Import-Package</code>, here
    <a href="https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/framework.module.html#framework.module.importpackage">
    https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/framework.module.html#framework.module.importpackage</a>.

    <p>If a Ghidra source bundle has no manifest, Ghidra <a href="#generated_files">generates one</a>.</p>

    <p>For example, the <code>@importpackage yourlib</code> in the previous example corresponds to the `yourlib` entry
      in the `Import-Package` line of the manifest generated for <code>my_ghidra_scripts</code>:
    </p>
    <pre>
    &lt;user home&gt;/.ghidra/.ghidra-&lt;version&gt;/osgi/compiled-bundles/ab12cd89/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF:
        Manifest-Version: 1.0
        Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
        Export-Package: mylib
        Import-Package: ghidra.app.script,yourlib,ghidra.app.plugin.core.osgi
        Require-Capability: osgi.ee;filter:="(&(osgi.ee=JavaSE)(version=11))"
        Bundle-SymbolicName: ab12cd89
        Bundle-Version: 1.0
        Bundle-Name: ab12cd89
        Bundle-Activator: GeneratedActivator
    </pre>
    The manifest generated for <code>your_ghidra_scripts</code> is as follows:
    <pre>
    &lt;user home&gt;/.ghidra/.ghidra-&lt;version&gt;/osgi/compiled-bundles/ef34ab56/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF:
        Manifest-Version: 1.0
        Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
        Export-Package: yourlib
        Import-Package: ghidra.app.plugin.core.osgi
        Require-Capability: osgi.ee;filter:="(&(osgi.ee=JavaSE)(version=11))"
        Bundle-SymbolicName: ef34ab56
        Bundle-Version: 1.0
        Bundle-Name: ef34ab56
        Bundle-Activator: GeneratedActivator
    </pre>
    <p>Notice the <code>Export-Package</code> line generated for <code>your_ghidra_scripts</code>.  The generated
    manifest exports all packages not including <code>private</code> or <code>internal</code>.</p>

    <p>For full control, users can include a manifest with their bundle's source,
    e.g. <code>my_ghidra_scripts/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code>. </p>


    <h2><a name="EnableBundles"/><a name="DisableBundles"/>Enabling and disabling bundles</h2>
    <p>For a bundle's contents to be available (e.g. for loading classes), its <a
    href="https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/framework.lifecycle.html#d0e9143">
    OSGi state</a> must be "<code>ACTIVE</CODE>".  Ghidra generally takes care of this, but
    the following provides more details about the underlying OSGi for debugging.</p>

    <p>Ghidra activates a bundle when added, enabled, or when a script contained within is
    run.<p>

    <p>When enabled, the root directory of a source bundle is also scanned for Ghidra scripts
    and any found are added to the script manager.</p>

    <p>When <em>dis</em>abled, any dependents of a bundle are stopped/deactivated first, then
    the bundle itself is stopped. Its scripts are then removed from the script manager.</p>

    <p>The color of each bundle path reflects state as follows:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left:8em">
      <li> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red">error</span> - e.g. the bundle file is missing
      <li> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#404040">disabled</span> - Ghidra knows the
        path, but that's it
      <li> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:black">inactive</span> - scripts are visible in the script
        manager, but no classes are loaded.  A bundle moves into this state when its
        dependencies become inactive (e.g. by being disabled), one of its scripts is deleted, or its cache is <a
        href="#CleanBundles">cleaned</a>
      <li> <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#009900">active</span> - the bundle is built and classes within
        can be loaded
    </ul>

    <p>The normally hidden column "OSGi State" is also available.  In addition to the Bundle
    state, this column will report</p>
    <ul style="padding-left:8em">
      <li> (DISABLED) - if the bundle is disabled
      <li> (ENABLED) - if the bundle is enabled, but the bundle manager has no handle to it.
        If this state persists, there is likely an internal error
      <li> (UNINSTALLED) - if the bundle is enabled, but the framework has released its handle.
        This is typical for an inactive bundle
    </ul>


    <h2><a name="AddBundles"/><a name="RemoveBundles"/>Adding and removing bundles from the manager</h2>
    <p>Adding a directory to the bundle manager will also enable it, so scripts within become
    available in the script manager.</p>

    <p>Removing a bundle disables it, so its scripts will be removed from the script manager
    and its dependents will become inactive.</p>


    <h2><a name="CleanBundles"/>Cleaning bundles</h2>
    <p>When Ghidra builds a source bundle, the results are written to the
    directory <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>&lt;user home&gt;/.ghidra/.ghidra-&lt;version&gt;/osgi/compiled-bundles/&lt;hash&gt;</code>. <br>
    These files can then be loaded by the OSGi framework.</p>

    <p>A <em>clean</em> deactivates then wipes this subdirectory for each selected bundle and
    clears its build summary.</p>

    <p>If a source bundle's imports aren't available during build, some source files can
    produce errors.  In order to force Ghidra to recompile, one must either modify the files
    with errors or <em>clean</em> the bundle then re-enable.</p>

    <h2><a name="RefreshBundles"/>Refresh bundles</h2>
    <p>Refresh will deactivate, clean, then reactivate every enabled bundle.</p>
