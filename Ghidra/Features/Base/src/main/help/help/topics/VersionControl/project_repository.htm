    <H1>Project Repository</H1>

    <P>Ghidra supports the concept of a <I>project repository</I> such that files in the repository
    can be <I>versioned</I>.&nbsp; <A name="Versioning"></A>Versioning allows you to track file
    changes over the life of the project.&nbsp; The repository supports check out, check in,
    version history, and viewing what is checked out. When you check in your file, a new version is
    created. The project repository can be used with or without a <A href=
    "help/topics/GhidraServer/GhidraServer.htm">Ghidra Server</A>. If the project is associated
    with a Ghidra Server, the project is <I><A name="SharedProject"></A>shared</I>, meaning that
    the <I>files in the project</I> are accessible by multiple users concurrently. The <A href=
    "help/topics/FrontEndPlugin/Ghidra_Front_end.htm#Edit_Project_Access_List">Project Access
    List</A> defines which users are allowed to access the shared repository.&nbsp; When you <A
    href="help/topics/FrontEndPlugin/Creating_a_Project.htm">create a new project</A>, you can
    specify whether it should be associated with a Ghidra Server.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

    <P>For projects that are not shared, all files and versions are managed locally in your project
    directory. For the shared project repository, files are maintained on the Ghidra Server. When
    you check out a file, a file is created locally in your project directory. When you check in a
    file, it is <A href="help/topics/Repository/Merge_Program_Files.htm">merged</A> (if necessary)
    with the latest version to create a new version. Merging is necessary only for shared project
    repositories, as with a non-shared project, the version you checked out is always the latest
    version.</P>

    <H2><A name="ConnectToServer"></A>Connect to the Server</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>When you open a shared project, Ghidra attempts to connect to the server that is
      associated with the shared project. Depending on what user authentication mode the server is
      using, you may have to enter a password. If the server is not running, you are still able to
      work with your checked out files while you are offline. Other versioned files not checked out
      are not accessible. When the server comes up, Ghidra will reconnect as necessary. You can
      also attempt to connect "manually" by selecting the connection status button <IMG alt="" src=
      "images/disconnected.gif" border="0"> on the Ghidra Project Window or on the <I><A href=
      "help/topics/FrontEndPlugin/Project_Info.htm">Project Info</A></I> dialog. When the
      connection is successful, the connection status button changes to <IMG alt="" src=
      "images/connected.gif" border="0">.&nbsp;</P>

      <P>If you lose the connection to the server after having started Ghidra, shared files not
      checked out "disappear" from the Ghidra Project Window, as they are unavailable. Private
      files remain intact and are not affected by the server connection.</P>

      <P><IMG alt="" src="../../shared/tip.png" border="0">You are authenticated only once per
      Ghidra session; so if you open other project repositories managed by the same Ghidra Server,
      you will be prompted only once for a password, as required.&nbsp;</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If you fail to connect to the Ghidra Server, check the following:</P>

        <UL>
          <LI>Verify that the client machine can "ping" the server machine.</LI>

          <LI>Verify that you are attempting to login using the correct authentication mode.</LI>

          <LI>Verify that the Ghidra Server administrator has added you as a user on the
          server.</LI>

          <LI>If the server is using Ghidra Password authentication, you may need to have your
          password reset to "<SPAN style=
          "font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">changeme</SPAN>" by the Ghidra Server
          administrator.</LI>

          <LI>Verify the host name and port of the Ghidra Server.</LI>

          <LI>Verify that the Ghidra Server is running: from a command window,
