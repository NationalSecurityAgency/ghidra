    <H1><A name="Extensions"></A> Ghidra Extensions</H1>

    <P>Ghidra Extensions are Ghidra software modules that can be installed 
    into a Ghidra distribution.  This allows users to create and share new plugins and scripts.
    Ghidra ships with some pre-built extensions that not installed by default. 
    </P>
    <P>Ghidra Extensions can be installed and uninstalled at runtime, with the changes taking effect
    when Ghidra is restarted. The extension installation dialog can
    be opened by selecting the <B>Install Extensions</B> option on the project <B>File</B> menu.</P>

      <P>The list of extensions is populated when the dialog is launched. To build the list, Ghidra
      looks in several locations:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI>Extension Installation Directories: Contains any extensions that have been installed.
        The directories are located at:</LI>

        <LI style="list-style: none">
          <UL>
            <LI><I>[user dir]/.ghidra/.ghidra_[version]/Extensions</I> - Installed/uninstalled from
            this dialog</LI>

            <LI><I>[installation dir]/Ghidra/Extensions/</I> - Installed/uninstalled from
            filesystem manually</LI>
          </UL>
        </LI>

        <LI>Extensions Archive Directory: This is where archive files (zips) that are bundled with
        the distribution are stored. It is
        located at <I>[installation dir]/Extensions/Ghidra/</I>.  This directory is not intended for
        end-user extensions.

      <P><B>Note:</B> Extensions that have been installed directly into the Ghidra installation
      directory cannot be uninstalled from this dialog. They must be manually removed from the

      <P>The existence of this file is what tells Ghidra that the folder or zip file is a Ghidra
      Extension. It is a simple property file that can contain the following attributes:</P>

	<H2>Building Extensions</H2>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	An extension is simply a Ghidra module that contains an <CODE>extension.properties</CODE> file.
	Building an extension is very similar to building a ghidra module, which is done by using
	<CODE>gradle</CODE>.
	</P>
	<P>
	Ghidra includes a <CODE>Skeleton</CODE> module in the distribution that is meant to be used as
	a template when creating extensions.   This module can be found at

		<CODE CLASS="path">&lt;GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/Extensions/Ghidra</CODE>
		</P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	Copy and rename this directory to get started writing your own module.  You can then use 
	<CODE>gradle</CODE> to build the extension by running this command from within your extension 
	directory:
