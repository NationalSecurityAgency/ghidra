      <P>The <I>Location References Dialog</I> displays all the memory reference destinations to a
      specific code unit that is described by the item under the current location. For example, if
      the current location is a referenced label, then the dialog will show references to that
      label and not the current address. In the following snippet, the label "LAB_40768a" is the
      field at the current location.</P>

      <P>Showing the <I>Location References Dialog</I> dialog at this location will show all
      references to the label "LAB_4078d2".</P>

      <P>This dialog also works with data types. If the item at the current location is a data
      type, then all places that data type is applied will be shown and the data type will be
      highlighted in the <I>Data Type Manager</I> tree.</P>

      <P>As another example, if the location is an XRef field location, then the dialog will show
      references to the address that the XRef field represents. In the following snippet, the Xref
      field "0040767d(j)" is the field at the current location.</P>
