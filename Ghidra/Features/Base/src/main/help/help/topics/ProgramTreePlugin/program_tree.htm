    <H1>Program Tree</H1>

    <P>The Program Tree&nbsp;shows a program organized into folders and fragments. Fragments
    contain code units (instructions, defined data, or undefined data). Code Units can reside in
    <I>one and only one fragment</I>. A folder is a container for other folders and fragments,
    however, it is not analogous to a&nbsp; folder in a "file system." Any folder, except for the
    root folder, and any fragment can have <I>multiple</I> parents. When you copy a folder or
    fragment to another parent folder, you are not creating a new instance of the folder or
    fragment, but simply adding the destination folder as another parent of the copied folder or
    fragment.&nbsp; This means that if you make a change to Folder "A" (e.g., create a new fragment
    or folder), the change is reflected where ever Folder "A" appears in the tree, regardless of
    the parent. Moving code units from one fragment to another does not affect the underlying
    memory.</P>

    <P>You can manipulate the tree organization by cutting, copying, and pasting folders and
    fragments to other folders. You can also use drag and drop to reorder the contents of a folder.
    You can apply algorithms to produce <A href="Program_Organizations.htm">organizations</A> based
    on a <A href="help/topics/BlockModel/Block_Model.htm">Block Model</A>. The following paragraphs
    describe features of the Program Tree.</P>

        <P>You can get the same effect of "Copy" and "Paste" by holding down the Ctrl key while
        dragging. (If you release the Ctrl key, the drag operation becomes a Move.)</P>

        <P>As stated earlier, you can drag code units from the Code Browser view and drop them onto

      <H3>Reorder Folder Contents using Drag and Drop</H3>

      <UL>
        <LI>Using Drag and Drop, you can reorder the elements within a folder. As you drag between
        nodes in the Program Tree, the cursor will change to indicate that a reordering
        operation&nbsp; is possible; you will see a solid bar between the nodes (<IMG src=
        "images/dragMoveCursor.gif">). When you release the mouse, the dragged folder or fragment
        will be repositioned at this location, i.e., <I>between</I> the two nodes where you
        released the mouse.</LI>

        <LI>&nbsp;If you are dragging to a different parent,&nbsp; in addition to the reorder, the
        drop operation will also cause the dragged fragment or folder to be <I><B>moved</B></I> to
        the parent of the destination drop site. To make a copy of the folder or fragment, hold
        down the Ctrl key while you are dragging. The cursor will change to <IMG src=
        "images/dragCopyCursor.gif"> depending on where the cursor is.&nbsp; If you release the
        mouse when the cursor indicates a potential reorder operation, the dragged folder or
        fragment is <B><I>copied</I></B> to the <I><B>parent</B></I> of the destination drop site,
        and is placed between the two nodes where you released the mouse. (Note that if the dragged
        folder or fragment already exists in the parent, then you will not get a valid drop target
        for reordering purposes.)</LI>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If you select multiple nodes in the Program Tree, some menu items in the popup menu
        (right mouse click) may not be enabled if the multi-selection is not valid. A valid
        multi-selection meets the following criteria:</P>

        <UL>
          <LI>If a folder is selected, then either all of its immediate descendants must be
          selected, or none of its immediate descendants is selected.</LI>

          <LI>The root folder is not part of the selection.</LI>
        </UL>

        <P>A valid multi-selection will cause the <B><FONT size="4">Copy</FONT></B>, <B><FONT size=
        "4">Cut</FONT></B>, <B><FONT size="4">Delete</FONT></B>, and view options to be
        enabled.</P>

        <P>The <B><FONT size="4">Delete</FONT></B> option may be enabled for a multi-selection,
        however, if the delete operation is not allowed on a particular folder or fragment, you
        will get a notification of why the delete failed.</P>
