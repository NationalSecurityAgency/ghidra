	<P>Ghidra supports multiple margin bars on the left side of the Listing
	that present various overviews for a program. 
  
    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P align="center"><IMG border="0" src="images/OverviewPanel.png"></P>
	
	<P>Each horizontal slice in
	the margin bar represents a relative address location in the program and is colored to 
	indicate the property associated with that address or region in the program.  The range of
	addresses represented in the margin bar is determined by the current view which by default is
	the entire address space of the program.

	<UL>
	<LI>Hovering the mouse on the margin bar will cause a tooltip to appear that gives you detailed
	information about the property and the address for that location. </LI>
	
	<LI> Left-clicking on the margin bar will navigate the listing to the associated address for the pixel
	that was clicked.</LI>
	
	<LI> Right-clicking on the margin bar will bring up a popup-menu which will at least include an
	option for displaying a legend for that particular overview.</UL>

	<H1> Overview Bar Types</H1>
     <H2><A name="AddressTypeOverviewBar"></A>General Overview Bar (Address Type)</H2>
   <BLOCKQUOTE>

       <P>The Address Type Overview Display shows a high-level view of the currently open program. Different
      colors are used to represent different types present in the program.  For each address as
      determined by the vertical pixel location, the program is consulted for what is at that address.</P>

      <P>The order of precedence for the coloring is as follows:</P>

      <OL>
        <LI><B>Function</B> - the address is within a function.</LI>

        <LI><B>External</B> - the address has references to external locations.</LI>

        <LI><B>Instruction</B> - there is an instruction at the address that is not currently
        defined to be in a function. </LI>
      
      	<LI><B>Defined Data</B> - a datatype has been applied to that address.</LI>

        <LI><B>Undefined Data</B> - the address has an associated byte value, but no
        datatype has been applied. </LI>
  		
  		<LI><B>Uninitialized</B> - None of the above. The address falls in an uninitialized memory block (no byte values)</LI>
      </OL>

      <P><IMG border="0" src="../../shared/note.png">Note that the overview panel only provides an
      approximation of the contents of a program. Although the level of detail can be increased by
      selected a more restricted view, there may still be imprecise summaries. For instance, if a region of memory
      contains mostly defined data, but the particular address that is rendered in the overview
      panel falls on an undefined block, the color for that pixel is set to undefined. In practice,
      however, this gives a good general sense of the various regions.</P>

    <H2><A name="EntropyOverviewBar"></A>Entropy Overview Bar</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    		<P>The entropy overview bar provides a byte based entropy statistic across the address set represented
    		by the overview bar. The statistic can frequently
      distinguish between the encoding complexity of different types of data typically present in
      binary executables, such as machine code, ASCII, and compressed data. An overview of this
      entropy score can often provide an at-a-glance classification of the program into its major
      sections and sub-sections, without requiring the presence of an image format header.</P>
    
        <H3><A name="Calculation"></A>Calculation of Entropy</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Entropy provides an estimate of the amount of <I>variation</I> in a set of data. For
        this plugin the data consists of the original bytes in the binary. Viewing the program as
        one long sequence of bytes, this sequence is split up into <B>chunks</B> with a default
        size of 1024 bytes per chunk. By calculating a histogram of all possible byte values,
        0-255, we can easily calculate the probability, p(x), of any particular value, x, occurring
        in that chunk. The <B>entropy</B> of this probability distribution is defined as:</P>

        <CENTER>
          <P><IMG src="images/Equation.png" border="0"></P>
        </CENTER>

        <P>This gives a single value, between 0.0 and 8.0, describing the amount of variation in
        that single chunk. A score of 0.0 indicates that only a single byte value occurred
        throughout the entire chunk, so the chunk can be described as having no variation or no
        entropy. The score can vary continuously through 8.0, or full entropy, which indicates that
        every possible byte value occurs equally often within the chunk.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3><A name="Encoding"></A>Data Encoding</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Most data encoding schemes show a bias in favor of certain byte values at the expense of
        others. ASCII, for instance, encodes only byte values between 0 and 127, and if the ASCII
        is being used to encode (English) error messages in a binary, there will be a further bias
        for the ASCII ranges encoding alphanumeric characters. Entropy picks up on this bias, and
        for many schemes, a chunk of data encoded with it will exhibit an entropy value in a very
        restricted range. ASCII error messages usually fall in the range 4.2 - 5.2. The Entropy
        Plugin can color-code these ranges so that certain encodings stand out immediately in the
        overview window. Because entropy is statistical in nature, a specific chunk of encoded data
        may not have an entropy value that falls inside the typical range. But across an entire
        program, the bias for particular ranges will be readily apparent, and major sections will
        stand out clearly.</P>

        <P>Entropy can easily distinguish between these common data encodings.</P>

        <UL>
          <LI><I><B>x86 Machine Code</B></I>: A specific instruction set like the Intel x86 has a
          very characteristic entropy range, which is well short of compression schemes, but packs
          more information per byte typically than ASCII. Different coding styles, compilers, etc.
          may have a consistent impact on the exact range of entropy values, but in general any
          block of machine code is easy to pick out.</LI>

          <LI><I><B>ARM/THUMB Machine Code</B></I>: There are two machine code specifications for
          ARM chips: ARM instructions and THUMB instructions. These both have entropy ranges
          similar to x86 machine code, but the ranges for ARM vs THUMB are distinguishable. ARM
          instructions, which must use 4 bytes per instruction, are slightly more wasteful in their
          encoding than THUMB, and this stands out in their entropy range.</LI>

          <LI><I><B>ASCII</B></I>: Entropy scores for ASCII encoded strings show its characteristic
          waste of the high bit in each byte and other biases for English letter frequency, null
          terminators, etc.</LI>

          <LI><I><B>Unicode</B></I>: The <I>wide character</I> format typically used to encode
          Unicode characters is particularly wasteful, with every other byte encoded as 0 for
          typical English strings. This shows up as a characteristic range of low entropy
          values.</LI>

          <LI><I><B>Compression/Encryption</B></I>: Data that has been compressed and/or encrypted
          typically shows very little bias at all in the byte values, and this corresponds to
          entropy scores very close to the maximum value of 8.0. Although entropy generally has
          little chance of distinguishing between different <I>kinds</I> of compression or
          encryption, this general category of encoding stands out quite clearly from other data
          typically found in a program.</LI>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Each color in the main bar encodes a specific entropy value, which can be determined by
        referring to the color palette which can be displayed by right-clicking on the bar and selecting
        the "show legend" action. The basic palette encodes
        entropy scores as a gradient, from black to white, for entropy scores from 0.0 to 8.0. In
        addition to this basic palette, the user can configure specific ranges to stand out with a
        specific color, which gets added into the base palette as a smaller color gradient.
        Multiple entropy ranges can be incorporated as distinct color gradients into the single
        palette. Each defined color range also has a label describing that range.</P>

        </CENTER>

        <P>Select the <B>Tool Options...</B> entry of the Code Browser <B>Edit</B> menu, and then choose
        <B>Entropy</B> from the tree navigator at the left of the Options dialog. This allows the
        user to configure different ranges incorporated into the palette and the size of chunk used
        in calculating a single entropy score. The Entropy Plugin has the following options:</P>
   
      <H4>Chunk size</H4>

      <P>The chunk size can be set to a value of 1024, 512, or 256 bytes. This controls over how
      many bytes a single entropy score is calculated. To a small extent, the user can trade off
      the granularity of the Entropy window with how much variation to expect across an entire
      region of similarly encoded data.</P>

      <H4>Entropy Range #</H4>

      <P>The Entropy window color palette supports up to 5 different highlighted ranges. For each
      of the 5 slots, this option presents a drop menu of common entropy ranges that can be
      selected. These include: <B>x86 code</B>, <B>ARM code</B>, <B>THUMB code</B>, <B>PowerPC
      code</B>, <B>ASCII strings</B>, <B>Compressed</B>, and <B>Unicode UTF16</B>. Slots that are
      unused can be set to <B>None</B>.</P>

      <H4>Range # color</H4>

      <P>The color that is used to highlight a specific range can be set with this option. Entropy
      values that hit the exact middle of the range will get assigned to the chosen color, and a
      steep gradient, connecting this color with the bounding colors within the base palette, will
      be used to fill out the color range.</P>
