      <P>The Call Tree Plugin shows all <B>caller functions</B> and all <B>functions called</B> for
      the <B>current function</B> (also known as the <B>main function</B>), which is the function
      that contains the cursor location in the <A href=
      "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm">Listing</A>. You can expand the nodes in each
      of the trees to show more information about these referenced functions. This plugin can be
      used to gain a quick context of a given function by seeing incoming and outgoing function
      calls.</P>

	  <P>
	  You can launch this component by clicking the 
	  <IMG src="Icons.ARROW_DOWN_RIGHT_ICON" border="0" /> icon in the Tool's 
	  toolbar, or by 
	  right-clicking in the Listing and selecting 
	  <B>References<IMG src="../../shared/arrow.gif" alt="-&gt;" border="0">Show Call Trees</B>

	  	<IMG border="0" src="../../shared/note.png">Unlike most widgets in Ghidra, the Call
	  	Trees display functions differently depending upon how you launch it.  
	  	<UL>
	  		<LI>
	  		When launched from the toolbar icon, the provider that is shown will track the 
	  		current location in the Listing (the <IMG src="images/locationIn.gif" border="1">
		      <A href="#Call_Tree_Action_Incoming_Navigation">Navigate on Incoming Location Changes

	  		When launched from the context popup menu, the provider that is shown will not track

	  		different functions, functioning much like <A HREF="help/topics/Snapshots/Snapshots.html">
	  		snapshots</A>, allowing you to keep a watchful eye on particular functions, regardless
	  		of where you navigate within the tool.

      <P><A name="Incoming_Call_Tree"></A>The <B>Incoming Calls</B> tree shows all caller
      functions. Each node in the tree has the incoming function call icon (<IMG src=
      "Icons.ARROW_DOWN_RIGHT_ICON" border="0">). Expanding a node in this tree shows all functions that
      are callers of the expanded node. Nodes may be expanded recursively to any depth desired.</P>

      <P><A name="Outgoing_Call_Tree"></A>The <B>Outgoing Calls</B> tree shows all functions
      called. Nodes with the outgoing function call icon 
      (<IMG src="Icons.ARROW_UP_LEFT_ICON" border="0">) represent functions 
      called by the current function that <B>also call other
      functions</B>.  Expanding a node in this tree shows all functions that are called by the 
      expanded node. Nodes may be expanded recursively to any depth desired.</P>

      <P>
      <IMG border="0" src="../../shared/tip.png">The default operation of the plugin display is 
      to <b>not</b> change as the location changes in the Listing.  This allows you to trigger
      navigation from inside of the trees without changing the function displayed by the trees.
      In order to see a new call trees window for the location in the Listing, you can do 
      so  by clicking the <IMG src="Icons.ARROW_DOWN_RIGHT_ICON" border=
      "0" /> icon in the Tool's toolbar, or by 
	  right-clicking in the Listing and selecting

      <A href="#Call_Tree_Action_Incoming_Navigation">Navigate on Incoming Location Changes button</A>
        on the call trees provider in order
       to have that provider change as the location in the Listing changes.

          border="1"> refresh button will reload the trees.   This is needed due to the fact that
          as changes are made to the program, the trees will not add and remove nodes in response.
          Thus, you can edit as much as you like without affecting the structure of the trees.
          The action's color will change to yellow if the provider detects that changes have
          taken place that <b>may</b> affect the structure of the tree.

          border="1"> action, when toggled on, will filter out duplicate function calls. 
          This setting is useful to see the set of all functions called. When
          toggled off this action will show all function calls, including duplicate calls, in
          address order. This setting is more useful to see the overall flow of the main

          setting.  Another example is the <a href="#Call_Tree_Context_Action_Expand_Nodes"> 
          expand action</a>, which will expand nodes recursively
          until the current depth setting is reached.  The depth of a given node is defined as the

          a function.  For example, you can expand all nodes to get an overview, pick a single

          interest.
