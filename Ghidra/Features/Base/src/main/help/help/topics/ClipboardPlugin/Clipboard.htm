    <P>Ghidra includes clipboard support so that data and code can easily be transferred in and out
    of your project. The Ghidra clipboard supports copying and pasting in a variety of formats
    (achieved by executing the <A href="#Copy_Special"><I>Copy Special...</I></A> command). Each
    window defines its own behavior for how the clipboard will function and what types of data will
    be copied.</P>

    <P>The Code Browser supports the following copy formats:&nbsp;</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><A href="#LabelsComments">Labels and Comments</A></LI>

      <LI><A href="#FormattedCode">Formatted Code</A></LI>

      <LI><A href="#ByteString">Byte String</A></LI>

      <LI><A href="#ByteString_NoSpaces">Byte String (no spaces)</A></LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The default copy operation in the Code Browser (achieved by executing the <A href=
    "#Copy"><I>Copy</I></A> command), however, will copy either selected text or the specific field
    under the cursor, depending upon the current selection and cursor location in the browser.</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>If there is a selection, then that selection's text will be copied.</LI>

      <LI>
        If there is no selection, then a copy <B>may</B> take place, depending upon the field under
        the cursor (this works for the Code Browser only). The following list of fields support
        copying:

        <UL>
          <LI>Operand Field Reference</LI>

          <LI>Label Field</LI>

          <LI>Comment Field</LI>

          <LI>Address Field</LI>

          <LI>Bytes Field</LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>To do the default copy, make a selection in the Code Browser, right mouse click and choose
    the <B>Copy</B> option.</P>

    <P>In order to copy labels and comments, right-click from within the Code Browser, Click
    <B><I>Copy Special...</I></B>, and choose the format you would like to copy. The last selected
    format is also available from the right-click popup menu.</P>

    <P>The clipboard supports the following operations:</P>

    <UL>
      <!--
              <li><i><b>Cut</b></i> - Cuts the currently selected items.  This is equivalent to copy, but the items will be moved when pasted.</li>
              -->

      <LI><I><B>Copy</B></I> - Copies selected items onto the clipboard.</LI>

      <LI><I><B>Paste</B></I> - Pastes the clipboard contents to the current location.</LI>

      <LI><I><B>Copy Special...</B></I> - Allows for a copy operation where the type/format copied
      is specified by the user.</LI>
      <!-- <li><i><b>Paste Special...</b></i> - Allows for a paste operation where the type/format copied is specified by the user.</li> -->
    </UL>

    <P>The clipboard allows for data to be both copied locally (within Ghidra) or onto the system
    clipboard. Data copied onto the system clipboard may be accepted by other applications.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3><A name="Copy"></A><IMG src="images/page_white_copy.png"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Copy</H3>

      <P>Copies the currently selected items. The behavior will be dependent on the specific window
      you copy from. Generally, copy means to place a copy of whatever is selected onto the
      clipboard so that it can be pasted in another location within Ghidra or to another
      application. The copy action can be triggered via the context menu that appears when you
      right-click.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3><A name="Paste"></A><IMG src="images/page_paste.png"> &nbsp;&nbsp;Paste</H3>

      <P>Pastes the clipboard contents to the current location. The behavior will be dependent on
      the specific window you paste to. Generally, paste means to insert a copy of whatever is on
      the clipboard to the location the cursor is currently at. Unlike the cut and copy actions,
      the paste action is always enabled because it cannot be notified of clipboard changes. If you
      attempt to paste and the data on the clipboard is not compatible with the window you pasted
      in, you will receive an error message. The paste action can be triggered via the context menu
      that appears when you right-click.</P>

      <P>The copy special dialog allows you to copy the selected information in a specific format.
      You can trigger the copy special dialog via the context menu that appears when you
      right-click. When the dialog appears, it will contain a list of the currently available
      formats. Choose the format you want and click <B>OK</B> to copy the selected information to
      the clipboard.</P>

      <P>The last selected format from the copy special dialog will appear on the popup menu along
      with the standard copy and paste operations (it is only visible when the last selected format
      is applicable). This feature allows you to repeatedly copy the same format quickly from
      either the menu or by binding a key to it. To specify a key binding, select <B>Edit</B><IMG
      border="0" src="../../shared/arrow.gif"><b>Tool Options</B>, click on <CODE>Key Bindings</CODE>,
      and choose the action for which you want to define a key. The action for repeat copying of
      the last format is called <CODE>Copy Special Again</CODE>. When available, the popup menu
      appears as follows:</P>

      <H3>Listing</H3>

      <P>The Code Browser <B>Listing</B> window can copy the following formats:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI><B>Formatted Code<A name="FormattedCode"></A></B> - Copies text from the selected
        blocks in the Code Browser to the clipboard. The spacing and formatting are preserved as
        much as possible. The plain text can easily be pasted into a text processor. <B>This is the
        default copy format</B>.</LI>

        <LI><B>Labels and Comments</B> <A name="LabelsComments"></A> - Copies the labels and
        comments from the selected blocks in the Code Browser to the clipboard. These can be pasted
        to another part of the program or to another open Code Browser, however, there is no
        external application that will paste the labels and comments. If you are pasting labels at
        a location where a default label exists, then the default label will be removed. Also, a
        default label cannot be pasted. Trying to paste a default label will result in no
        change.</LI>

        <LI><B>Byte String<A name="ByteString"></A></B> - Copies the bytes from the selected blocks
        in the Code Browser to the clipboard as text. These can be pasted to another part of the
        program (provided the area pasted to is undefined) or to an external application that
        supports pasting byte strings. Often, hex editors will be able to paste this format.</LI>

        <LI><B>Byte String (No Spaces)</B> <A name="ByteString_NoSpaces"></A> - This is the same as
        the Byte String format, except there are no delimiting spaces between bytes.</LI>

		<LI><B>Python Byte String</B> - Copies the bytes into the Python byte string format, for
		example: <CODE>b'\x41\xec\x49\x89'</CODE>.</LI>
		
		<LI><B>Python List String</B> - Copies the bytes into the Python list format, for
		example: <CODE>[ 0x66, 0x2e, 0x0f, 0x1f, 0x84 ]</CODE>.</LI>
		
		<LI><B>C Array String</B> - Copies the bytes into the C array format, for
		example: <CODE>{ 0x66, 0x2e, 0x0f, 0x1f, 0x84 }</CODE>.</LI>

        <LI><B>Address</B> - Copies the address at the top of the selection.</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>The Code Browser <B>Listing</B> window can paste the following formats:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI><B>Labels and Comments</B> - Labels and comments can be pasted anywhere in the
        program.</LI>

        <LI><B>Byte String</B> - Any string of text bytes can be pasted into an undefined region of
        the program. White space will be ignored.</LI>

        <LI><B>Label String</B> - Available when a default copy was performed while there was no
        text selection. This value can be pasted onto a label or comment.</LI>

        <LI><B>Comment String</B> - Available when a default copy was performed while there was no
        text selection. This value can be pasted onto a comment.</LI>

        <LI><B>Byte String</B> - Available when a default copy was performed while there was no
        text selection. This value can be pasted onto a comment.</LI>

        <LI><B>Address String</B> - Available when a default copy was performed while there was no
        text selection. This value can be pasted onto a comment.</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>The paste is able to determine the type of data on the clipboard and will paste the
      appropriate type when it is triggered.</P>
