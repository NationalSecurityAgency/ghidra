    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P>The fallthrough address on an instruction is the address of the <I>next</I> instruction that
    will be executed. You can change the fallthrough address by using the <I>Set Fallthrough
    Address</I> dialog, as shown below. By default, an instruction's fallthrough address (or lack
    thereof) is determined by the language processor. For example, a "return" or a "jump"
    instruction does not have a fallthrough address.</P>

    <H3>Set a Fallthrough Address</H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The dialog shows the default fallthrough address of the instruction. The radio buttons
      below the <I>Fallthrough Address</I> field indicate whether the address is the default
      fallthrough or user defined. When the <B>Default</B> button is selected, the <I>Fallthrough
      Address</I> field is disabled. If an instruction has no default fallthrough (e.g., "jump"),
      the Fallthrough Address field is empty. Choose the <B>User</B> button to enter a new
      fallthrough address. When the <B>User</B> button is selected, the <I>Fallthrough</I>
      <I>Address</I> field is updated as you move the cursor in the the Code Browser.</P>

      <P>Select the Home button to navigate the Code Browser back to this address. The home panel
      shows the address and the instruction when you selected the <B>Set</B> option.</P>

      <P>To change the fallthrough address,</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>Position the cursor on an instruction.</LI>

        <LI>Right mouse click and select <B>Fallthrough</B><IMG border="0" src=
        "help/shared/arrow.gif"><B>Set...</B> to display the dialog.</LI>

        <LI>Select the <B>User</B> radio button.</LI>

        <LI>Enter an address
        (or <A href="help/topics/Misc/AddressExpressions.htm">Address Expression</A>), or click in
        the Code Browser at the address of the new fallthrough.</LI>

        <LI>Select the <B>Apply</B> button to change the fallthrough and leave the dialog intact;
        select the OK button to change the fallthrough and dismiss the dialog.</LI>
      </OL>

      <P>You can see the effects of setting the fallthrough address by selecting the <A href=
      "help/topics/Selection/Selecting.htm#Select_Limited_Flows_From">limited flows from option</A>; the
      instructions that are skipped over via setting the fallthrough address are not included in
      the selection.&nbsp;</P>
      
      <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/tip.png">
      	 Just below the overridden address will be a comment indicating the override, containing
      	 the text <b>Fallthrough Override</b>, along with the updated fallthrough address.
      </P>

      <P>To clear a fallthrough address using this dialog, select the <B>None</B> button, then

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The "auto override" feature skips over data following an instruction, finds the next
      instruction following the data and sets this address as the fallthrough address. You can
      automatically override the fallthrough address for a single instruction or override the
      fallthrough addresses over a <A href="help/topics/Selection/Selecting.htm">selection</A>.</P>

      <P>To auto override,</P>
