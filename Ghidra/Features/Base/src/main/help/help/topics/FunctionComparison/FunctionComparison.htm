    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The <B><I>Listing View</I></B> shows a pair of listings side by side so the functions can
      be compared. The highlights in the two listings indicate where there are possible differences
      in the bytes and instructions between the functions. The background highlights that have a 
      default color of <SPAN style="background:#b9b9b9">gray</SPAN> are where bytes or instructions differ
      wherever the instructions could be matched up between the two functions. The code units with
      white background also have a matching code unit in the other function but do not have any
      differences based on the current difference settings. Any instructions that couldn't be
      automatically matched up are highlighted with a default background color of
      <SPAN style="background:#69cde1">blue</SPAN>. 
      The detailed differences with a default background color of light 
      <SPAN style="background:#afff69">green</SPAN> within
      the gray difference code units indicates individual bytes and parts of instructions that
      differ between a code unit in one function and its matching code unit in the other function
      using the current difference settings.</P>
      <P><IMG src="help/shared/note.png" border="0">The user can change these colors from the 
      <B>Properties</B> action in the popup menu of the Listing View or from the

      <P>If you move the cursor within one of the listings, if possible it will move the cursor to
      the matching location in the other listing. Scrolling one listing will scroll the other. The
      two listings are locked together for scrolling at the code unit where the cursor last had a
      matching code unit in the other listing. In other words as the cursor moves within the code
      units that have white and gray backgrounds, the cursor in the other listing will also move to
      the matching code unit. When the cursor moves into a code unit that is unmatched 
      (with a default blue background), the
      cursor in the other listing will not move since it doesn't have a matching code unit.</P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The left side margin of each listing can display a cursor arrow <IMG alt="" src=
      "images/cursor_arrow_flipped.gif"> that indicates the code unit with the current cursor
      location. In the active side of the dual listing, the cursor arrow will always display to
      indicate the current cursor location. The inactive side of the dual listing will also show
      the cursor arrow whenever its matching location was able to be determined. If the active
      side's cursor location is on an unmatched code unit then the other side's cursor arrow will
      not appear.</P>

      <P>Whenever the cursor arrow appears and there isn't already another background color, the
      code unit background will be highlighted <SPAN style="background:#e8f2fe">light blue</SPAN>
      to help you determine where the red location cursor is located in the listing. If the cursor
      is on a code unit with an indicated difference or an unmatched instruction then that
      associated background color will take priority and will display instead of the light blue
      highlight.</P>

        <P>There are actions in the toolbar that control the layout of the two listings in the

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>If you hover the mouse over a reference in either listing A popup window will appear
          showing a listing at the part of the program being referenced. You can also hover over a
          field in the listing that contains truncated text, which will show you the entire text in
          a popup. You can turn the hover popup windows off using the <IMG alt="" src=
          "images/hoverOn.gif"> mouse hover button in the toolbar.</P>

            mouse hover popups off and the icon will switch to a <IMG alt="" src=
            "images/hoverOff.gif">.</LI>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>If the <IMG alt="" src="images/lock.gif"> button is showing in the toolbar then
          the dual listing or dual decompiler will synchronize scrolling of the left and right 
          function in their views. Scrolling or moving the cursor in one side will cause the 
          location in the other side to also scroll or move if a matching location can be 
          determined.</P>
          <P>When the <IMG alt="" src="images/unlock.gif"> button is showing in the toolbar the
          left and right sides of the dual listing or dual decompiler will scroll independent
          of the other side.</P>

        <H4><A name="Apply_Function_Signature_To_Other_Side"></A>Apply Function Signature To Other
        Side</H4>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>The <B>Apply Function Signature To Other Side</B> action is available in the Function
          Comparison window from the popup menu. This will apply the function signature from the
          side of the panel that has focus (the one with the pink border around it) to the function
          in the other side.</P>

          <P>When you apply the signature it updates the other side's function so its signature
          will match the function's signature in the side with focus as closely as possible. This
          will try to create conflict names if necessary for the function and its parameters.</P>

          <P>To apply the signature from one function to the other:</P>

          <OL>
            <LI>Right mouse click in the side of the Function Comparison Window that has the
            function signature that you want to apply.</LI>

            <LI>Choose the <B>Apply Function Signature To Other Side</B> option from the menu.</LI>
          </OL>

          <P>The function signature in the non-focused side of the Function Comparison window
          should update if the apply succeeded.</P>
