    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The <B><I>Listing View</I></B> shows a pair of listings side by side so the functions can
      be compared. The highlights in the two listings indicate where there are possible differences
      in the bytes and instructions between the functions. The background highlights that have a 
      default color of <SPAN style="background:#b9b9b9">gray</SPAN> are where bytes or instructions
      differ wherever the instructions could be matched up between the two functions. The code units
      with white background also have a matching code unit in the other function but do not have any
      differences based on the current difference settings. Any instructions that couldn't be
      automatically matched up are highlighted with a default background color of
      <SPAN style="background:#69cde1">blue</SPAN>. 
      The detailed differences with a default background color of light 
      <SPAN style="background:#afff69">green</SPAN> within
      the gray difference code units indicates individual bytes and parts of instructions that
      differ between a code unit in one function and its matching code unit in the other function
      using the current difference settings.</P>
      <P><IMG src="help/shared/note.png" border="0">The user can change these colors from the

      <P>If you move the cursor within one of the listings, if possible it will move the cursor to
      the matching location in the other listing. Scrolling one listing will scroll the other. The
      two listings are locked together for scrolling at the code unit where the cursor last had a
      matching code unit in the other listing. In other words as the cursor moves within the code
      units that have white and gray backgrounds, the cursor in the other listing will also move to
      the matching code unit. When the cursor moves into a code unit that is unmatched 
      (with a default blue background), the
      cursor in the other listing will not move since it doesn't have a matching code unit.</P>

      <P>The left side margin of each listing can display a cursor arrow <IMG alt="" src=
      "images/cursor_arrow_flipped.gif"> that indicates the code unit with the current cursor
      location. In the active side of the dual listing, the cursor arrow will always display to
      indicate the current cursor location. The inactive side of the dual listing will also show
      the cursor arrow whenever its matching location was able to be determined. If the active
      side's cursor location is on an unmatched code unit then the other side's cursor arrow will
      not appear.</P>

      <P>Whenever the cursor arrow appears and there isn't already another background color, the
      code unit background will be highlighted <SPAN style="background:#e8f2fe">light blue</SPAN>
      to help you determine where the red location cursor is located in the listing. If the cursor
      is on a code unit with an indicated difference or an unmatched instruction then that
      associated background color will take priority and will display instead of the light blue
      highlight.</P>

      <P> Synchronized scrolling works by matching a line in one decompiled function with a line in 
          the other decompiled function.  The two functions are aligned relative to the matched 
          line; scrolling up or down will then move each decompiled function by the same amount. 
          Whenever you click on a token, the functions are re-aligned.  If the token you clicked on
          has a match, the functions will be re-aligned using the corresponding line.  If the token 
          does not have a match, a search is performed for the nearest token in the same function
          which does have a match, and the functions are re-aligned using the search result.  
      </P>

      <P>There is no limit to the number of functions that can be compared. Users may
      add and remove functions from each comparison panel as desired. Simply use the pulldowns 
      above the listing panels to change what is being compared.</P>

      <P>The following toolbar options are available:</P>

	<blockquote>
		<h3><IMG src="images/AddToComparisonIcon.png" border="0">  
		<a name="Add_To_Comparison"></a>Add To Existing Comparison</h3>
		<p>Allows the user to add functions to the current comparison window. When
		selected, the following table containing all functions in the current program is
		displayed:</p>
		<p>
		<IMG src="images/AddFunctionsPanel.png" border="0">
		</p>
		<p>Select the functions to be added and hit the <b>OK</b>
		button; the selected functions will be available in both the left and right
		sides of the comparison window. 
		</p>
		
		<h3><IMG src="images/RemoveFromComparisonIcon.png" border="0">  
		<a name="Remove_From_Comparison"></a>&nbsp;Remove Function From Comparison</h3>
		<p>Removes the function in the focused panel from the comparison. This
		will remove the function from both the source and target selection pulldowns.</p>
		
		<h3><IMG src="images/NavNextIcon.png" border="0">  
		<a name="Navigate_Next"></a>&nbsp;Go To Next Function</h3>
		<p>Navigates to the next available function in the selection pulldown</p>
		
		<h3><IMG src="images/NavPreviousIcon.png" border="0">  
		<a name="Navigate_Previous"></a>&nbsp;Go To Previous Function</h3>
		<p>Navigates to the previous available function in the selection pulldown</p>
		
		<h3><IMG src="Icons.NAVIGATE_ON_INCOMING_EVENT_ICON" border="0">  
		<a name="Navigate_To_Function"></a>&nbsp;Navigate To Selected Function</h3>
		<p>When toggled <b>on</b>, the function comparison panels become navigable,
		meaning a mouse click on the panel or change in the function being viewed
		will result in a GoTo event being generated. This allows other panels 
		(eg: the listing) to update their views accordingly.</p>
		
		<p><IMG src="help/shared/note.png">  The Remove and Go To actions described
		above will operate on the comparison panel that has focus, identified by the
		pink border.</p>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>If you hover the mouse over a reference in either listing A popup window will appear
          showing a listing at the part of the program being referenced. You can also hover over a
          field in the listing that contains truncated text, which will show you the entire text in
          a popup. You can turn the hover popup windows off using the <IMG alt="" src=

          <P>If the <IMG alt="" src="images/lock.gif"> button is showing in the toolbar then
          the dual listing or dual decompiler will synchronize scrolling of the left and right

        	<A name="Function_Comparison_Apply_Name">

        	where structures and unions are not copied, but instead empty placeholders are created.

        	<A name="Function_Comparison_Apply_Signature_And_Datatypes">
        	<LI><B>Apply Function Signature and Data Types</B> - This will apply the function name, 
        	namespace and full signature, including any complex data types and referenced types. Use
        	this action with caution as it can potentially add many inappropriate and conflicting
        	data types, especially if the source function is from a program with a different 
        	architecture or compiler.
