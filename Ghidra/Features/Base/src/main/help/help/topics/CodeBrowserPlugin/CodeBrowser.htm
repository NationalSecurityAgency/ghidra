    <H1><A name="Code_Browser"></A><A name="Listing"></A>Listing View</H1>

    <P>The Listing View is the main windows for displaying and working with a program's instruction
    and data.</P>

    <P align="center"><IMG border="0" src="images/CodeBrowser.png" alt=""></P>

    <P align="center">Listing View</P>

    <H2>Main Display</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>In the Code Browser tool displayed above, the Listing is shown to the right of the <A
      href="help/topics/ProgramTreePlugin/program_tree.htm">Program Tree</A>. The Listing is
      currently showing a snippet of code for "WinHelloCPP.exe". Code is made up of various
      elements such as addresses, bytes, mnemonics, and operands. The Listing uses <I>fields</I> to
      display these elements. The overall layout of the Listing can be changed by adjusting the
      size and position of the fields using the <A href="Browser_Field_Formatter.htm">Browser Field
      Formatter</A>.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="View"></A>The View</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Listing can either display an entire program or a subset of a program. The <I>view</I>
      determines the set of addresses that are displayable in the Listing. By default, the view
      contains the entire program, but other Ghidra components can restrict the view to some subset
      of the program. For example, the <A href=
      "help/topics/ProgramTreePlugin/program_tree.htm">Program Tree</A> can be used to restrict the
      view to a module or fragment. If the view is larger than the screen size, a vertical scroll
      bar will appear that allows the display to be scrolled anywhere within the view.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Location"></A>Cursor</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Listing maintains a cursor location. Even though the Listing never actually changes a
      program, it plays an important role for plugins that do. Many Ghidra plugins operate at a
      specific address or even on a specific field on an instruction at an address. These plugins
      use the Listing's cursor position to determine the appropriate "program location".</P>

      <P>The cursor can be moved by using any of the "arrow" keys or by clicking the mouse over any
      appropriate location.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Selection"></A>Selection</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Listing also maintains a selection (shown using a green shaded area). Some plugins
      operate on a particular address. Other plugins can operate over a range of addresses. For
      these plugins, the selection is used to determine the range of address on which to
      operate.</P>

      <P>A selection can be set by either dragging the mouse while holding down the left mouse
      button or by pressing the &lt;shift&gt; key while moving the cursor with the "arrow"
      keys.</P>

      <P>Pressing the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key down while clicking the mouse will either add to the
      selection if that line is not already in the selection or it will remove that line from the
      selection.</P>

      <P>Clicking the mouse anywhere (without dragging) will cause the selection to go away.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Highlight</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Since the selection is transient (it goes away easily), the Listing also has the concept
      of a highlight. The highlight is similar to the selection, but it stays around until it is
      explicitly cleared. To create a highlight, first create a selection and then use the <A href=
      "help/topics/SetHighlightPlugin/Highlighting.htm">Highlight</A> menu to convert the selection
      to a highlight. Later the highlight can be converted back into a selection using the same
      menu. At that point an action can be applied to the selection.</P>

      <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/note.png" alt="">Highlights are not saved across program
      sessions. To achieve a lasting color effect, you can <A href=
      "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/ListingBackground.html">color the Listing background</A>.</P>

    <H2><A name="Navigation"></A>Navigation</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Listing provides built-in navigation functionality for addresses and labels.
      Double-click on any address, label or reference markup within the Listing and it will attempt
      to reposition to that location if it exists in the program. If the address exists in the
      program but not in the current view, the view is expanded to include the address. If the
      location refers to an external location and it is associated with another program, that
      program may be opened and positioned within the CodeBrowser. See the tool <A href=
      "help/topics/Tool/ToolOptions_Dialog.htm">Edit Tool Options</A> dialog for control over
      certain Navigation behaviors.</P>

		
	  <A name="Show_Xrefs"></A>
      <P>In the XRef field, sometimes there are too many addresses to display so the field will
      display "[more]" to indicate that one or more cross-reference addresses are not shown.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/tip.png" alt=""> Double-clicking on the "<FONT color=
        "green"><TT>XREF[n]:</TT></FONT> or <FONT><TT>[more]</TT></FONT>" text will cause a 
        dialog containing all the Xrefs to appear.</P>
        <P>
        This differs from the <A href=
        "help/topics/LocationReferencesPlugin/Location_References.html#LocationReferencesPlugin">
        <B>Show References to ...</B></A> feature in that the Xrefs dialog is simply a display
        of what already exists in the database, whereas <B>Show References to ...</B> will
        perform a search to find references additional to what is in the database.
        </P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P align="left">This dialog lists all the Xref addresses, any labels that are at that address
      and a preview of the instruction at that address. Clicking on any row in the table will cause
      the browser to navigate to that address</P>

    		<BLOCKQUOTE>
    			<P>
    			Available when viewing all Xrefs to a particular function, this toolbar action 
    			allows you to see not only xrefs directly to the function, but also any xrefs to
    			functions that thunk that function as well.   With this action toggled on you will
    			see all Xrefs to the final 'base' thunked function, along with all Xrefs to 
    			functions that thunk that function, regardless of which function was used to launch
    			the dialog.  Alternatively, when toggled off, you will only see those Xrefs that
    			point to the function used to launch the dialog.

        size of the text exceeds the field size and is therefore truncated. A tooltip-like window
        is displayed showing the entire contents of the truncated field (provided the contents fits
        on the screen). This is particularly useful for long strings and data within a program that
        cannot be fully displayed. The figure below shows an example of a truncated text popup.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Because the mouse hover popup windows can sometimes get in the way, a mechanism for
        quickly disabling them is included. Simply click the icon illustrated above to toggle mouse
        hover mode. This icon appears in the top right corner of the Listing's toolbar whenever a
        mouse hover plugin is loaded. When clicked, the icon will change to indicate the new
        state.</P>
        <!-- Caution about the button and options -->

        <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/note.png" alt=""> Clicking the icon has no effect when

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>You may also expand and collapse data structures from the right-click popup menu via the
        <B>Expand All Data</B>, <B>Collapse All Data</B>, <B>Expand All Data In Selection</B>,
        <B>Collapse All Data in Selection</B>, and <B>Toggle Expand/Collapse Data</B> actions
        respectively. These actions are only available when the popup menu is activated under
        certain conditions. The actions are described in detail below:</P>

        <UL>
          <LI><B>Expand All Data</B> - This action will expand a data element and all its children
          recursively starting with the data at the cursor location. This action will only appear
          when the cursor is on a data that is expandable.</LI>

          <LI><B>Collapse All Data</B> - This action will recursively collapse the outer most
          expandable data element containing the data at the cursor location. This action will only
          appear when the cursor is on an expandable data element or any of its child elements at
          any level.</LI>

          <LI><B>Expand All Data In Selection</B> - This action will search the current selection
          and find all expandable data elements and then recursively expand each such data element
          and all its children. This action is available whenever there is a selection.</LI>

          <LI><B>Collapse All Data In Selection</B> - This action will search the current selection
          and find all expandable data elements and then recursively collapse each such data
          element and all its children. This action is available whenever there is a
          selection.</LI>

          <LI><B>Toggle Expand/Collapse Data</B> - This action will toggle the expanded/collapsed
          state of an expandable data element. If it is expanded, it will collapse it and if it is
          collapsed, it will expand it. Additionally, if the cursor is on a non-expandable data
          element that is contained in a parent expandable data element, then the parent element
          will be collapsed. This action is available whenever the cursor is on an expandable data
          element at anly level or when the cursor is on a data element inside another data
          element.</LI>
        </UL>

        <P><IMG border="0" src="help/shared/note.png" alt="">The <B>Expand All Data</B> and
        <B>Collapse All Data</B> actions behave differently. The <B>Expand All Data</B> recursively
        opens the data starting at the location of the popup menu. The <B>Collapse All Data</B>
        action, on the other hand, always works on the <B>outermost</B> data structure, regardless
        of where in the containing structure the popup menu was activated.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Listing is comprised of many fields which are used to display the individual elements
      of a program (address, bytes, operand, etc). Clicking the middle mouse button on a field
      places the cursor in that field and causes the text under the cursor to become highlighted
      along with all other occurrences of that text. For example, in the figure below, the cursor
      is on the "PUSH" mnemonic at address 0x01004072. Notice that every "PUSH" on the screen (not
      just the mnemonics) is also highlighted. Specifically, the "PUSH" in the comment is
      highlighted. The Cursor Text Highlight makes no distinction as to what type of information is
      being highlighted. To determine matches that should be highlighted, a case-sensitive
      whole-word string compare is used.<BR>

        <P>This feature has additional functionality when used on registers. In this case, the
        highlight can be restricted to show the "Scope" of a register. The "Scope"<A name=
        "Scope"></A> of a register starts where the register is assigned a value and ends at the
        last use of the register before it is written with another value (when a register is both
        read and written, then it will be shown as a read).</P>

        <P>When the middle mouse is clicked on a register, the scope of the register is computed.
        The register is highlighted from the point it is initially assigned a value (written) to
        the point it is last uses that value. With "Scoping", three different colors are used. The
        read highlight color is used at locations where the register value is read (light green in
        the image below). A slightly darker color is used at the location where the register is
        written (dark yellow in the image below). All other matching registers outside of the
        current scope will be highlighted with the default highlight color (yellow in the image
        below).</P>

        <P>This feature can be turned off by adjusting highlight settings (see below).</P>
