    <P>The Structure Editor is used to define the contents of a structure data type. It can be used
    to create a new structure or to modify existing ones. Structures are user defined data types
    that contain components. A component is a data type of a particular size and at a specified
    offset in the structure. The following illustrates the editor for a structure data type.
    </P>

    <DIV align="center" style="margin-top: 10px;">

    </DIV>
    
    <BR>
    <P>As shown above, the Structure Editor also includes a bit-level view of the structure layout to improve 
    understanding of bitfield placement when they are present.  Note that the byte ordering is
    reversed for little-endian data organizations to ensure that a bitfield is always rendered
    as a contiguous bit range.  If inadequate space is available for a component label,
    within the bit view of the component, it will be omitted.  However, holding down the Shift-key
    while using the mouse wheel on a component will zoom the view in and out
    allowing component labels to appear when space permits.  The bit view may also be used to make
    and reflect single component selections with the table.  Within the bit view any <i>padding</i> bits not visible within
    the table view as a component will include a small dot in the center of the displayed bit cell.<BR>

    <P>The Union Editor is very similar to the Structure Editor, but is used to create or modify a
    union data type. All the components of a Union are at an offset of 0. The following illustrates
    the editor for a union data type.</P>

      <UL>
        <LI><I>Edit Actions</I>: The icon buttons at the top of the editor are used to modify this
        structure. Each button has a different <A href="#Structure_Editor_Edit_Actions">edit
        action</A> associated with it. These allow the user to: apply changes, insert 
        Undefined components, reorganize the current components, duplicate components, clear components (changes
        them to <i>undefined</i> components), delete components, create array components, and unpackage a
        structure or array component changing it into its component parts.<BR>

        a cycle group or favorite.<BR>
        </LI>

        <LI><I>Component Table</I>: The upper portion of the editor contains a table with the
        structure's or union's components. Each component (or row) consists of its offset, length,
        mnemonic, data type, field name, and comment. See the <A href=
        "#Structure_Editor_Component_Fields">Component Fields</A> section for more about these
        fields. The data type, field name and comment are editable fields. The data type's category
        can be determined by <A href="#Structure_Editor_Show_Component_Path">showing the data type
        category</A>. Components can be <A href="#AddDataType">added</A>, <A href=

      All non-packed structures and unions (i.e., pack disabled) will have a default alignment of 1 (byte aligned)
      unless a <A href="#Structure_Editor_Align">minimum alignment</A> value has been specified.  For packed structures and unions
      the actual alignment value is calculated based on the <A href="#Structure_Editor_Pack">pack</A> setting, 
      preferred alignments of the individual components, 
      and the minimum alignment setting. The size of a packed structure or union will always be a multiple

      <P>
      This alignment is considered when this data type, or derivative data type, is placed within another packed composite.

    <H3>Non-Packed Structures</H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>When packing is disabled for a structure all bytes are accounted for
      by the displayed components.  Use of <i>undefined</i> filler components as padding and reservation of space. 
      This differs from a packed structure which does not reveal padding in the form of components and does not provide
      a means of reserving space.
      Non-packed structures may be used to position components with known data
      types at specific offsets within a structure whose size has been specified. When editing a non-packed structure
      the editor attempts to prevent defined components from moving
      to a different offset when performing operations like drag and drop which may consume undefined bytes. 
      The default alignment for non-packed structures is 1-byte but may be overriden by setting a specific 
      non-default <A href="#Structure_Editor_Align">minimum alignment</A>. 
      The alignment will not influence the size of a non-packed structure so it is advised
      that the size always be explicity set to a multiple of the alignment value.<BR>

    <H3>Packed Structures</H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>A packed structure is defined similar to a structure in a C header file and is intended 
      to automatically adjust component placement, size and alignment in a manner consistent 
      with the associated compiler specification. Data types
      are specified for each of the components, but their offsets are automatically computed
      based upon the pack settings and preferred alignment of each component's data type. A default
      datatype (i.e., <i>undefined</i>) cannot be added to a packed structure, although other sized datatypes 
      (e.g., <i>undefined1</i>, <i>undefined4</i>, etc.) may be used as component place-holders and will 
      pack appropriately based upon their size.   The overall size of the structure is
      determined by the components it contains, the pack setting (default or explicit value) and the minimum alignment setting. 
      The default alignment and pack behavior is controlled by the effective data organization.  This can
      cause the same structure viewed within a program to be layed-out quite differently than within a datatype archive 
      which uses a default data organization.</P>   
      <P>The following image shows the editor state reflecting a default packed structure with 
      default alignment.<BR>

        <LI>explicit value - The radio-button with a text field next to it allows you to specify an

    <H2><A name="Structure_Editor_Bitfields"></A>Bitfield Component</H2>

    <P>A structure and union may define bitfield components which attempt to model 
    bitfield definitions found within C/C++. Unlike other byte-oriented components, 
    bitfield components have the following characteristics: 
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      	<ul>
      		<li>A bitfield datatype may not exist anywhere other than within a structure or union.</li>
      		<li>A bitfield datatype may not be selected via the datatype chooser or tree since it
      		requires the specification of additional attributes (e.g., bit-size, bit-offset).  The
      		bit-size is generally appended to the base datatype for datatype specification and 
      		presentation purposes (e.g., char:1).</li>
      		<li>A zero-length bitfield may be defined within a byte but its precise bit position
      		is controlled by endianess alone.  A zero-length bitfield has no affect within a non-packed
      		structure and is intended for use within packed structures where it may impart alignment
      		affects based upon compiler conventions.</li> 
      		<li>Inserting a bitfield within a non-packed structure may cause component shifts based 
      		upon the specified offset and allocation unit byte size when a placement conflict occurs.</li>
      		<li>The start/end byte offsets may be shared with adjacent bitfield components.</li>
      		<li>Unoccupied bits within a partially occupied byte are not represented by any component
      		(similar to padding bytes within packed structures).</li>
      		<li>A separate <a href="#Structure_Bitfield_Editor">Bitfield Editor</a>, for use with non-packed structures only, 
      		must be used to precisely place a bitfield component.  Adding a bitfield component via the 
      		structure table view via datatype text entry (e.g., char:1) provides only rough placement for non-packed 
      		structures since additional bytes will be introduced. 
      		The BitField Editor may be displayed using the the Add Bitfield and
      		Edit Bitfield popup menu actions on a selected structure component.  The datatype text entry approach
      		must be used for all unions and packed structures.</li>

    <P>A structure may be defined with zero-element array components, also referred to as a 
    flexible array, which correspond to an unsized array (e.g., char[0]).  Such a component
    is created by simply specifying a zero-element array datatype as you would a sized-array component
    (see <A href="#Structure_Editor_Create_FlexArray">Create
    Zero-Element / Flexible Array Component</A>).
    The resulting component will not consume any space within the structure and will report a component
    size of 0. As such, it may reside at the same offset as a subsequent component and/or may have an offset 
    equal to the length of the structure. When packing is enabled such a component may influence the 
    overall alignment of the structure and its length.

        <P><B>Pointer Data Type</B></P>

        <P>This can be a named Pointer data type (e.g., <i>pointer</i>, <i>pointer16</i>, etc.) or a pointer to a specific data type. A pointer to a data
        type is indicated by following the data type name with an * (i.e., asterisk symbol).  It is also possible to stipulate a specific pointer-size, although it should be
        only done when the default pointer size is inappropriate.  A stipulated pointer size may be specified by following the * with its bit-size
        (16,24,32..64).  The pointer * designation may also be stacked for a pointer-to-pointer type.</P>

        <P>For example, <i>word*</i> is a pointer to a Word using the default pointer size.  If a non-default size is needed <i>word*16</i> would force

        <P>A single or multidimensional array of any <A href="#Structure_Editor_Basic_Data_Type">basic data type</A> may be specified.</P>

        all integer types (e.g., byte, char, int, etc.), a defined enum, or a typedef which corresponds to an integer-type or enum.
        It is important to note that specifying a bitfield in this manner works well for packed structures, however for non-packed
        structures it may be neccessary to use the <A href="#Structure_Editor_Bitfield_Actions">Bitfield Actions</A> to properly define a bitfield.</P>

        <P>A non-packed union's size will always be the size of its largest component. If you
        change a data type for a component and the component size changes, the union size will
        change if necessary.  A packed union is padded to make its size a multiple of the union's
        alignment.<BR>
        </P>

        <P>How a structure is affected by changing a component's data type depends on whether the
        structure size is packed or non-packed.</P>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><B>Non-Packed</B> - If the structure has <I>pack disabled</I>, then the new component must
          be less than or equal to the original component's size plus any <i>undefined</i> components
          that immediately follow it in the structure. Decreasing the
          component size will create <i>undefined</i> components following it to maintain the
          structure size and placement of other components. Increasing the component size replaces 
          <i>undefined</i> components immediately
          following the component. The last component of a structure can always be changed which
          can cause the structure to grow larger.<BR>
          </P>

          <P><B>Packed</B> - If the structure is <I>packed</I>, a component can change size or alignment,

      <P>Pressing the '<B>p</B>' key invokes the pointer action on a component. This will generally
      create a default pointer unless the existing data is already a pointer in which case that

      action will always apply a default sized pointer. Otherwise you can drag one of the other
      pointer types from the <I>Data Type Manager</I> window. With existing pointer data, the base
      type of that pointer may be changed simply by applying another type onto the pointer (e.g.,
      applying byte to default pointer becomes db *). If you do not want this pointer stacking
      behavior to happen, it is best to clear the code unit(s) before applying a data type via

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>The Bitfield Editor is used by the Structure Editor when adding or modifying bitfield components
    within non-packed structures to facilitate precise placement at the bit level.  The Bitfield Editor
    is not supported for unions and packed structures since automated packing is performed (i.e.,
    bitfields are specified via datatype text entry within the structure/union table view).  
    While editing a non-packed structure, the Structure Editor popup menu actions <B>Add Bitfield</B> 
    and <B>Edit Bitfield</B> are used to launch the Bitfield Editor.</P>
    
    <P>The Bitfield Editor includes a visual depiction of the storage allocation bytes and associated
    bits (8-bits per byte, with a left-to-right / msb-to-lsb sequence of 7..0 ).  The displayed byte 
    ordering as conveyed by the <B>Byte Offset</B> header
    will differ for big-endian vs. little-endian.  This is done to ensure that bitfields which span 
    byte boundaries will always visually appear as a consecutive range of bits. The <B>Component Bits</B>
    display provides both a popup menu and mouse assisted bitfield manipulations.  Component labels 
    are included within each component when space permits.  The color legend indicates the bit 
    color scheme reflecting Defined bitfields, Defined non-bitfields, Edit bitfield bits, Conflict bits
    and Undefined bits.  A dot in the center of an Undefined bit indicates a padding bit not included
    within any defined component.  Conflict bits correspond to the current edited bitfield where 
    bits have been specified in conflict with an existing component.</P>
    
    <P>While the Bitfield Editor is displayed local popup menu actions
    are provided which can facilitate additional component manipulations (e.g., <B>Add Bitfield</B>, 
    <B>Edit Bitfield</B>, <B>Delete</B>).  These actions relate to the component at the current
    mouse cursor location.   An addition popup menu toggle action available over the bitfield 
    viewer is <B>Show Byte Offsets in Hexadecimal</B>.  Invoking either the <B>Add Bitfield</B> or 
    <B>Edit Bitfield</B> local popup menu actions will immediately cancel the current bitfield 
    operation if one is active.</P>

    	<P><IMG alt="Note:" src="help/shared/note.png"> Within the Bitfield Editor the bit
    	size may not exceed the size of the Base Datatype based upon the structure's 
    	associated compiler convention (i.e., 
    	data organization).  Since archives use default 
    	integer type sizes which may differ from a target program's datatype sizing, the use of fixed-size base 
    	datatypes may be preferred.  Otherwise, structure edits should be performed within the 
    	target program where datatype sizes may be larger. If an existing bitfield size exceeds 
    	the size of the base datatype within
    	the associated data organization the "effective" bitfield size will be reduced.  As with other 
    	components, structure component sizing may change when moving between a datatype archive and 
    	a target program.</P>  
    	
    	<P><IMG alt="Note:" src="help/shared/note.png"> It is important to note that the retained bitfield
    	storage specification (byte offset, component byte size, bit offset) will utilize the smallest possible 
    	values while preserving bitfield positioning within the structure.  The allocation unit offset and size
    	conveyed by the editor are for editor use only.</P>
