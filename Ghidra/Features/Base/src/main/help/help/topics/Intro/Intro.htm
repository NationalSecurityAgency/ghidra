    <H1>Introduction</H1>

    <P>Ghidra is a highly extensible application for performing software reverse engineering.
    Ghidra is built upon a completely generic application framework. Application-specific
    capabilities are provided by small software bundles called plugins, each providing one or more
    features. This user's guide provides detailed information on how to use both Ghidra's generic
    and reverse engineering-specific capabilities.</P>

    <H2>Intended Audience</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This guide is intended for anyone interested in learning how to use Ghidra to reverse
      engineer a software system.</P>

    <H2>Document Scope</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The purpose of this document is to describe how to use Ghidra. It does NOT provide
      information on the software architecture or the programming API.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Disclaimer</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Ghidra is configurable. At any given time, Ghidra capabilities can be added, removed, or
      even replaced by changing the current set of plugins. Consequently, a feature might not be
      available as described and the images shown in this document may not exactly match your
      display.</P>

      <H3>Extensions</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>There are a number of Ghidra plugins that are not part of the base distribution. They
        are either experimental, still under development, or contributed by others. These plugins
        may not have been tested, and therefore may be unstable and are not included in any of the
        default tools. However, these plugins often contain the more cutting edge features and may
        be worth considering. They are easily accessible and can be added by <A href=

      <H3>IDA Pro Export</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The Ghidra distribution includes a plugin for use with IDA Pro (a commercially available
        disassembler). The XML plugin is used with IDA Pro to export IDA Pro databases as XML files
        so that they can be imported into Ghidra. This allows IDA Pro users to migrate their data
        to Ghidra.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>To add the XML exporter plugin to your IDA installation:</P>

        <UL>
          <LI>Locate the README file for your version of IDA from the version folders in the
          &lt;ghidra installation directory&gt;/Extensions/IDAPro folder. The plugin is available
          for IDA Pro versions 6 and 7. If you are unsure of your IDA version, start IDA and select
          Help -&gt; About program ... from IDA's main menu to display the version.</LI>
        </UL>

        <P>To export data to Ghidra using the XML plugin, select File -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Dump
        database as XML file... from IDA's main menu.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Ghidra is a project-oriented application and, consequently, all work must be performed in
      the context of a project. Therefore, the first thing to do is to <A href=
      "help/topics/FrontEndPlugin/Creating_a_Project.htm">create</A> a project or <A href=
      "help/topics/FrontEndPlugin/Opening_a_Ghidra_Project.htm">open</A> an existing project. Once
      a project is open, Ghidra will display the folders and data that make up the project along
      with the user's current set of tools. Of course, newly created projects would not contain any
      data. Data must be <A href="help/topics/ImporterPlugin/importer.htm">imported</A> into a
      Ghidra project before any work can be performed. Importing data into a Ghidra project creates
      <I><A href="help/topics/Glossary/glossary.htm#Program">programs</A></I> that Ghidra <A href=
      "help/topics/Tool/Ghidra_Tool_Administration.htm">tools</A> can manipulate.</P>

      <P>A Ghidra tool is a configuration of plugins that can be used to manipulate programs. When
      Ghidra is first installed, a default tool - the code browser tool - is created for the user
      and its icon is displayed in the Tool Chest area of the Ghidra Project Window.</P>

      <P>To <A href="help/topics/Tool/Ghidra_Tool_Administration.htm#Run_Tool">run a tool</A>,
      click on its icon in the <I>Tool Chest.</I> When a tool is running, a new window will appear
      for that tool and the tool's icon will be displayed in the <I>Running Tools</I> area of the
      Ghidra Project Window.</P>

      <P>Ghidra also supports the concept of <I>workspaces</I>. A <A href=
      "help/topics/FrontEndPlugin/Ghidra_Front_end.htm#Workspace">workspace</A> is simply a
      collection of running tools that are visible on the desktop. Users can have multiple
      workspaces, each with its own set of running tools. Running tools that are not in the current
      workspace are still running and consuming system resources even though they are not
      visible.</P>
