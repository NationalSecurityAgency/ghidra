    <H1>Docking Windows</H1>

	    <P>Ghidra tools provide various GUI components that allow users to view and manage
	    programs.&nbsp; The Docking Windows feature allows users to customize the layout of these
	    "Dockable" components within a Ghidra tool.</P>
	
	    <H2>The Basic Dockable Component</H2>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		    <P>The image below shows a tool with three <B><I>Dockable Components</I></B>:&nbsp; <I>Program
		    Trees</I>, <I>Listing,</I> and <I>Data Type Manager</I>.</P>

    <P>Each component consist of several common parts:</P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	    <H3>Title Bar</H3>
	
		    <BLOCKQUOTE>
		      <P>The title bar is at the top of the component and displays the title of the window.
		      It also serves as a handle for dragging the component to other positions within the
		      tool. &nbsp;The title bar's color indicates whether the component has keyboard focus.
		      When the component has focus, the title bar is blue, otherwise it is gray. Only
		      one component can have focus at a time.</P>
		    </BLOCKQUOTE>
	    
	    
	    <H3>Local Toolbar</H3>
	
		    <BLOCKQUOTE>
		      <P>The title bar also serves as a local toolbar.&nbsp; It contains icons for actions that
		      apply only to this component. Hovering the mouse over an icon causes a tool tip to be
		      displayed. The tool tip give a hint as to what the action will do if you select the icon.
		      </P>
		    </BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	
	    <H3><A name="Local_Menu"></A>Menu Icon <IMG src="images/menu16.gif" alt=""></H3>
	
		    <BLOCKQUOTE>
		      <P>The menu icon will appear if the dockable component has a local menu. &nbsp;As with the
		      local toolbar, the local menu item applies only to this component. Mouse click on the icon to
		      show the menu.</P>
		    </BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	        <H3><A name="Close_Window"></A>Close Icon <IMG src="help/shared/close16.gif" alt=""></H3>
	    
			    <BLOCKQUOTE>
			      <P>Select <IMG src="help/shared/close16.gif" alt=""> to hide the dockable component.
			      The component will be removed until you select the component's name from the 
			      tool's <I><A HREF="#Windows_Menu">Window</A></I> menu.  Some components, such 
			      as search results, are transient and are permanently removed when you close 
			      these components.</P>
			    </BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	        <H3>Work Area</H3>

    <H2>Arranging Components</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><I>Docking Windows</I> allows users to arrange components into configurations that best
      fit their needs. There are three ways components can be arranged in a tool:&nbsp;</P>

      <OL>
        <LI><I><B>Docked with other components</B></I>: components are side-by-side (or top to
        bottom) with another component.</LI>

        <LI><I><B>Stacked with other components</B></I>: components share the same window space,
        and tabs are used to display them one at a time.</LI>

        <LI><I><B>In their own window</B></I>: a component can be placed in its own window.</LI>
      </OL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Moving Components</H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>

	      <P>Components can be rearranged by dragging them in various ways. &nbsp;To drag a component,
	      press and hold the left mouse button on the title bar (header) or tab of the component to be
	      moved, then begin moving the mouse to drag it around. &nbsp;Press ALT to include in the drag
	      all the components at the right of the first tab drew out or ALT+SHIFT for all components at
	      the left. &nbsp;Pressing ALT after dragging by a title bar would select all components found
	      in the same window space, and ALT+SHIFT would invert the sorting of the selection. &nbsp;The
	      selected tabs will be highlighted, while a transient window popup listing their names traces
	      the mouse motions. &nbsp;The mouse cursor changes to indicate what would happen if the mouse
	      button is released at that location. &nbsp;While in the same window space, ALT and ALT+SHIFT
	      set the direction of the selection, respectively, from left to right, or from right to left,
	      dynamically cutting this selection at the tab where the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/invalid.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Invalid Location - releasing
	      here will cancel the drag operation. &nbsp;This is the same as holding SHIFT, to temporarily
	      invalidate a drag. &nbsp;Then, release the left mouse button to cancel and conclude the drag
	      or release the SHIFT key to resume to drag normally.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/leftArrow.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Move the group of selected
	      components to the left of the window space that the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/rightArrow.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Move the group of selected
	      components to the right of the window space that the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/upArrow.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Move the group of selected
	      components above the window space that the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/downArrow.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Move the group of selected
	      components below the window space that the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/hover.stack.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Stack the group of selected
	      components in the window space that the mouse cursor is over, creating a tabbed pane effect,
	      appending the selected components. &nbsp;This is what would happen when dropping over a content
	      space.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/header.stack.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Stack the group of selected
	      components in the window space that the mouse cursor is over, creating a tabbed pane effect,
	      prepending the selected components. &nbsp;This is what would happen when dropping over a
	      title bar (header).<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/push.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Push the group of selected
	      components between other tabs, moving the hovered tab to the right of that group. &nbsp;This is
	      what would happen when dropping over a tab in another window space.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/shift.left.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Shift the group of selected
	      components, moving the group before the hovered tab. &nbsp;This is what would happen when
	      dropping over a tab, in the same window space, located at the left of that group.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/shift.right.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Shift the group of selected
	      components, moving the group after the hovered tab. &nbsp;This is what would append when
	      dropping over a tab, in the same window space, located at the right of that group.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/window.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Place the group of selected
	      components in a new window. &nbsp;This mode is temporarily activated while holding CTRL.
	      Then, release the left mouse to confirm the drop or release the CTRL key to resume to drag
	      normally.<BR>
	      </P>

	      <P><IMG src="help/shared/tip.png" border="0"> To get the arrow cursors to appear, move near
	      the inside edge of a window space. &nbsp;To get the stack cursor, move over a content space
	      (to append components), or over a title bar (to prepend components). &nbsp;To get the shift,
	      or push cursors, respectively, move over a tab in the same window space, or in another one.
	      To get the new window cursor, hold CTRL after starting to drag. &nbsp;While CTRL isn't hold
	      down, the Invalid Location cursor appears if the mouse is outside of any drop zone, or over
	      the desktop, or over the tab of the component first selected in the group or over its title
	      bar if not part of stacked components. &nbsp;To cancel a drag operation, hit ESC, click a
	      different button, or hold just SHIFT and then release the left mouse button. &nbsp;CTRL+ALT
	      and CTRL+ALT+SHIFT can move a group of selected components in a new window. &nbsp;To dock a
	      group of components, hold just ALT or ALT+SHIFT. &nbsp;Hold ALT to extend a selection from
	      the first dragged tab to all at its right, or ALT+SHIFT to those on its left. &nbsp;If the
	      drag operation was started by pulling a header, ALT would select all tabs, and ALT+SHIFT is
	      to invert the sorting order of the group dragged around, unless hovering a tab in the same
	      window space. &nbsp;While in the same window space, this kind of multiple selection is cut
	      at the tab hovered by the mouse cursor, so that a group of components can shift after that
	      tab, if at the right side of that group, or before that tab, if at the left side.</P>

      <H3>Resizing components</H3>
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	      <P>Docked components are separated by thin borders. &nbsp;When the mouse is moved over a
	      border which separates two docked components, the cursor will change to a resize <IMG src=
	      "images/resize.png" alt=""> icon. To change the relative size of the components, press the
	      left mouse button while over a border and drag the border in the appropriate direction.</P>

	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		 <P>
		 	<B>Transient</B> components (e.g., search windows) can be renamed.  Right-click on 
		 	either the title bar or tab of a transient window and a popup menu item will
		 	appear that allows you to change the title of that component.  This can be useful
		 	when you wish to better identify search results when you have performed many 
		 	searches.

	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		 <P>
		 	When more than one component is stacked in the same window space, the components are presented as
		 	tabbed components. This means that only one of these components is shown at any given
		 	time and a series of tabs, one for each component in this space, is displayed at the 
		 	bottom of the main viewing area. Clicking any of these tabs will make that tab's 
		 	corresponding component become the visible component.</P>
		 	<P>Right-clicking on a tab will present a popup menu with the following actions:</P>
		 	<UL>
		 		<LI><B>Rename</B> - This action allows the user to change the short name shown in the
		 		tab. This action is only available on transient components such as search results.</LI>
		 		<A name="Closing_Tabs"/>
		 		<LI><B>Close Others</B> - This action closes all other tabs. (and their 
		 		corresponding components)</LI>
		 		<LI><B>Close Tabs to the Left</B> - This action closes all tabs to the left of the
		 		clicked-on tab. This action is not available for the first tab.</LI>
		 		<LI><B>Close Tabs to the Right</B> - This action closes all tabs to the right of the
		 		clicked-on tab. This action is not available for the last tab.</LI>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>

	    <P>Each component currently loaded in the tool has a corresponding entry in the tool's
	    <I>Window</I> menu. The menu item for a component can be used to show a component that is
	    currently not visible. &nbsp;If the component is already showing, it will be brought to the
	    front (if it is behind some other component or windows) and the component will be made active
	    (have keyboard focus).&nbsp; Temporary windows such as search results are shown at the bottom
	    of the menu below the separator bar.&nbsp; Multiple windows of the same type are grouped into
	    sub-menus. &nbsp; For example the following snapshot of a window menu indicates there are
	    several search results windows open.</P>
