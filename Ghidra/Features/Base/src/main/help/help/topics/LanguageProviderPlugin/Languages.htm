<h1>Processor Languages</h1>
<p>All processors have an associated language that defines the mapping
between
user readable assembly language instructions (e.g. MOV, ADD,
etc.)&nbsp; and their
corresponding byte values.&nbsp; In order to disassemble a binary image
for a
specific processor, Ghidra requires a <i> language module</i> for that
processor.&nbsp;
A language module is the software that implements the language
translation.
Ghidra has a set of language modules for the most commonly-used
processor
languages. New languages can be added to Ghidra by writing new language
modules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ghidra uses a processor modeling language called <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Sleigh </span>to define the binary
parsing and instruction symantics associated with each language.&nbsp;
The semantic information allows for
more
advanced analysis and enables features such as the decompiler. <br>
</p>
<p>The list of available languages can be found in the <b>Ghidra Release Notes</b>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="set_language"></a>Setting a Program's Language</h2>
<p>All programs are initially assigned a Processor Language when they
are first imported into a project.&nbsp; The processor language can be
changed, but only to a closely related language.&nbsp;
Any stored register values will
be transferred if there is a register with the same name in the new
language.&nbsp; If a matching register can't be found those values will
be removed.</p>
<p><img src="../../shared/note.png">
If your program has been added to version control in a <a
 href="help/topics/VersionControl/project_repository.htm#SharedProject">shared
project</a>, you must first have an <a
 href="help/topics/VersionControl/project_repository.htm#ExclusiveLock">exclusive
check out </a>on the file before you can set the language.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition, the program file may not be open in a tool when changing
the assigned processor language.</p>
<p> To change the processor language, right-click on the prorgam file
within the <span style="font-style: italic;">Project Window</span>
data tree, and setlect <span style="font-weight: bold;">Set Language...</span>
from the popup menu.&nbsp; Since setting the language is such a major
change, the following warning will appear.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="images/Warning.png"></p>
<p align="left">Alternatively, if your file is versioned, you you
should check-in any recent changes prior to performing this
operation.&nbsp; If you press the "OK" button, the Select Language
dialog will be displayed:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Languages.png"></p>
<p align="left">Select the language from the list and press "OK" to
change the processor language for the current program.&nbsp; If the
selected language is
sufficiently similar to the existing language, the change will be
made.&nbsp; Otherwise, an error dialog will appear and the change will
not be allowed.
<i>By default, a filter will automatically be applied that displays the
most
compatible languages. It is recommended to only use one of these
languages.<br>
</i></p>
<p align="left"><img src="../../shared/note.png">
Once the operation completes successfully the only way to
revert to the previous language (aside from attempting another Set
Language) is to undo your checkout if it is versioned.&nbsp; Otherwise,
you must rely on a backup copy which you hopefully made prior to the
operation.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;<img src="../../shared/note.png">
Set Language will fail if any old address
space can not be mapped to the same size or larger address spaces
within the new language.&nbsp; This allows migration to larger
processor implementations (e.g., 32-bit to 64-bit), but not the reverse.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="CodeBrowserPlugin_PCode"></a>PCode</h2>
<p>The semantic information provided by the SLED and SLEIGH-based
languages is called PCode (a form of generic microcode).&nbsp; Each
assembly language instruction can be
broken down into one or more PCode instructions.&nbsp; The more
advanced automatic analysis features in Ghidra require PCode in order
to operate.
</p>
<p>To see PCode, add the PCode field in the Instruction/Data tab of the
<a href="help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/Browser_Field_Formatter.htm">Browser Field</a>.&nbsp;
The figure
below shows a CodeBrowser with the PCode field added.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
