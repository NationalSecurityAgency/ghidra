    <H1><A name="Query_Results"></A> Search Results Window</H1>

    <P>The <I>Search Results</I> window displays search results from various sources (plugins). The
    window is useful for navigating to a resultant location or selecting some number of result
    locations for another operation that requires a selection. The information displayed in each
    column may differ depending on the search operation that populated the window. However, the
    window's capabilities are the same. The image below shows the results of a search. You will
    also see the <I>Search Results</I> window when you do a <A href=
    "help/topics/Navigation/Navigation.htm#Go_To_Address_Label">Go To</A> for matching a wildcard
    entry.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <TABLE border="0" width="100%">
        <TBODY>
          <TR>
            <TD width="100%" align="center"><IMG border="0" src="images/QueryResultsSearch.png" alt=""></TD>
          </TR>
        </TBODY>
      </TABLE>
    </CENTER>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Each row of the table is associated with an address or location within the program. There
      may be multiple entries for the same address, depending on the type of search. For example,
      when searching text, a string may appear multiple times in the same pre-comment. So, you will
      see an entry for each in the Search Results window. The title bar shows the number of entries
      being displayed.</P>

      <P>The tool has an <A href=
      "help/topics/Tool/ToolOptions_Dialog.htm#OptionsForTool">option</A> for the maximum number of
      search results. The search will stop after this number has been exceeded. To see more search
      results, <A href="help/topics/Tool/ToolOptions_Dialog.htm#SearchLimit">increase your search
      limit</A>.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>As with most tables in Ghidra, you may change the location of the cursor within the tool
      by clicking on the various table cells. The location to which the cursor is moved depends
      upon which table cell is clicked. For example, clicking on the location column will move the
      cursor to the location where the match was found. Alternatively, clicking on a label in the
      label column will move the cursor to the corresponding label in the listing panel.</P>

    <H3>Marker Margins</H3>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>When searching strings or memory, a yellow arrow marker <IMG border="0" src=
      "images/searchm_obj.gif" "> is placed in the left hand marker margin at
      each location in the browser that a match was found. The location of each search result in the
      entire view is displayed as a yellow box in the right hand Navigation Margin. You can
      navigate to a search result by left-mouse-clicking on the yellow box in the Navigation margin.
      The Navigation margin provides a general overview of where in the program any search results
      were found.</P>

	      <P>A selection in the Listing can be created from the entries in the results table. 
	      The selection can also be used as input to another operation that uses
	      the current selection, e.g., a follow-on search that is restricted to the results of the
	      first search using the current selection.</P>

	      <P>You can remove entries from the table via this action.  Items are <b>only</b> removed
	      from the table--no program data is changed.  This can be useful when you wish to 
	      exclude results that are of no interest to you.</P>

	    <BLOCKQUOTE>
	      <P>This action causes the Listing to navigate to the address represented by a row when
	      that row is selected. Toggling this action on allows you to use the up and down arrow keys to
	      change the selection in the table while also navigating to that address in the Listing.
	      You may also use this action to trigger navigation when single-clicking a table row.<BR>
