    <P>Disassembly is the process of translating bytes into assembly language instructions.&nbsp;
    Ghidra supports three different disassembly actions:</P>

      <P><I>Disassembly</I> starts disassembling at the current cursor location.&nbsp; After
      disassembling an instruction, it examines all possible execution flows from that instruction
      and disassembles at all those locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

      <P>When disassembling in a selection, the disassembly starts at the first undefined byte
      within the selection.&nbsp; After exhausting all possible flows from the instruction,
      disassembly begins again at the next undefined byte within the selection.</P>

      <P>To perform <I>Disassembly</I>:</P>

      <OL start="1" type="1">
        <LI>Place your cursor at the target instruction</LI>

        <LI>Right-mouse-click</LI>

        <LI>Select Disassembly</LI>
      </OL>

      <P>The disassembly progress is displayed in the progress status area (bottom right) of the
      tool.&nbsp; The progress status area displays the number of instructions disassembled and
      provides a "Cancel" button.&nbsp; Press the "Cancel" button to stop the disassembly
      process.&nbsp; Note: this will not undo any disassembly that has already occurred.</P>

    <H2><A name="Disassembler_Options"></A>Disassembler Options</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The following <I>Disassembler</I> options exist which control certain behaviors during
      <I>Disassembly</I>:</P>
      
      <ul>
      
      <li><b><i>Mark Bad Disassembly</i></b> - places an error bookmark on any instruction or 
      instruction flow which fails to disassemble due to parse error or instruction conflict
      (Enabled by default). </li>
      
      <li><b><i>Mark Unimplemented Pcode</i></b> - places a warning bookmark on any instruction
      which has <i>unimplemented</i> pcode/semantics at the time disassembly was performed 
      (Enabled by default).  The <i>MarkUnimplementedPcode</i> script may be run to update
      these warnings since processor language updates may implement previously unimplemented
      instruction pcode.</li>
      
      <li><b><i>Restrict Disassembly to Executable Memory</i></b> - If enabled will restrict
      disassembly to those memory blocks marked as executable (Not restricted by default).  </li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <P>The above <i>Options</i> may be changed via the program Options dialog which allows various 
      program properties to be examined or modified.  This dialog may be accessed via the menu action <B>Edit<IMG
          src="../../shared/arrow.gif">Options for ...</B> for the currently active program.  These
          options are program specific and stored within the program database.  The above program
          properties can be accessed by clicking the <I>Disassembler</I> node within the 
          <i>Properties</i> tree.  Any changes to these options will be stored when the <B>OK</B> or 
          <B>Apply</B> button is clicked within the dialog. </P>
          
      <P>These option settings will be utilized for both forced disassembly and during 
      auto-analysis.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The difference between <I>Disassembly</I> and <I>Static Disassembly</I> is that Static
      Disassembly does not follow flow and only disassembles one instruction.&nbsp; However, when
      disassembling in a selection, the disassembly starts at the first undefined byte within the
      selection and proceeds sequentially to the last byte.</P>

      <P><I>Restricted Disassembly</I> is similar to <I>Disassembly</I>, except that only bytes in

      disassembled.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><I>Disassemble ARM and Disassemble Thumb</I> will only be available if the program you are
      working with is an ARM based processor.&nbsp; ARM processors have two states, ARM and Thumb
      mode.&nbsp; The instructions available in ARM mode are 4 bytes long.&nbsp; In Thumb mode, the
      instructions are "generally" 2 bytes long.&nbsp; ARM and Thumb mode are mutually exclusive,
      the processor is either executing Thumb encoded instructions or ARM encoded
      instructions.&nbsp; However, certain branching instructions can cause the processor to switch
      modes.&nbsp; The default mode for disassembly in an ARM program is to disassemble in ARM
      mode.&nbsp; If you come across a section of Thumb code that has not been disassembled,
      Disassemble Thumb will set the disassembler into Thumb mode and begin disassembly.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>The actions work exactly like <I>Disassemble</I> in that they start disassembling at the
      address under the cursor, and will follow the execution flow.</P>

      <P>To perform <I>Disassemble ARM or Disassemble Thumb</I>:</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>Place the cursor in the Code Browser on an undefined byte.</LI>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    	<P>With certain processors and situations it may be desirable to modify the default 
    	flow of an instruction to better reflect the nature of its flow.  For example a jump may 
    	actually be performing a call type operation, a call may be performing a long-jump.  
    	This distinction primarily affects the subroutine models and flow analysis performed 
    	within Ghidra.</P>
    	<P>The following basic flow types may be imposed upon the default flow of an instruction:</P>
    	<UL>
    		<LI>BRANCH</LI> 
    		<LI>CALL</LI>
    		<LI>CALL_RETURN</LI>
    		<LI>RETURN</LI>
    	</UL>
    	<P>In all situations the conditional nature of the original flow is perserved.</P>
    	<P>To Modify Instruction Flow:</P>
    	<OL>
    		<LI>Place the cursor on an instruction within the Code Browser.  Note that
    		instructions which are purely fall-through can not be modified.</LI>
    		<LI>Right-mouse-click</LI>
    		<LI>Select <I>Modify Instruction Flow...</I> menu item.
    		<LI>Within the <I>Modify Instruction Flow</I> dialog select the desired basic flow
    		behavior.</LI>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Some processors have "modes" or state information that affects how they will interpret and
      execute the bytes that make up an instruction. To support this, Ghidra creates a psuedo
      register called the "contextRegister" that contains bits corresponding to the different modes
      or options of the processor. &nbsp;The language specifies a default for these modes, but the
      user can effectively change the defaults using the <B>Processor Options</B> dialog.<BR>
      </P>

      <DIV align="center">

        <DIV align="left">
          <BR>
        </DIV>
      </DIV>

      <P>The options are
      specific to the processor and the user should refer to the processor manual for a description
      of a processors modes. Whenever, disassembly takes place these are the assumed values that
      will be used to initiate disassembly, unless the user has specifically set the values at an
      address using the &nbsp;<B><A href="help/topics/RegisterPlugin/Registers.htm">Register
