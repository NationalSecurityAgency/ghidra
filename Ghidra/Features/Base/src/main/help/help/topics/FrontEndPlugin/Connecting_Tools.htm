    <H1>Tool Connections</H1>

    <P>Ghidra Tools that share data and interact dynamically are said to be <I>connected</I>.&nbsp;
    Tools are connected via <I>tool events</I>.<A name="ToolEvents"></A> Tools generate events when
    you:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>open or close a&nbsp; Program&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>

      <LI>move the cursor to a different location in the Program&nbsp;</LI>

      <LI>make a <A href="help/topics/Selection/Selecting.htm">selection</A> in the Program (drag
      the mouse over some addresses).&nbsp;</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>A main reason to connect tools is to have one tool track Program location or selections in
    another tool.</P>

    <P>A tool may generate events that only another tool of this type can process,<A name=
    "SpecialToolEvent"></A> e.g., the Code Browser in one tool produces and consumes an edit event
    that is appropriate for a Code Browser in another tool. Thus, tools can be connected for only
    those events that they have in common.</P>

    <P>Tool connections are directional. You can connect two Tools A and B in a <I>single
    direction</I> such that Tool A generates an event consumed by Tool B; however, Tool A will not
    consume any events generated by Tool B.&nbsp; You can also connect Tools A and B such that the
    connections are <I>bi-directional</I>, where Tool A generates an event consumed by Tool B, and
    Tool B generates an event consumed by Tool A.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

    <P>The following sections describe the ways to connect tools.</P>

    <H2><A name="AutomaticToolConnection"></A>Automatic Tool Connection</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>You automatically connect tools when you:</P>

      <UL>
        <LI>drag the icon for one running tool onto another running tool, OR&nbsp;</LI>

        <LI>drag the icon from the <A href="Ghidra_Front_end.htm#ToolChest">Tool Chest</A> onto the
        icon for the running tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI>
      </UL>

      <P>The tools are connected in both directions for all events (all Tool A events will be
      consumed by Tool B, and all Tool B events will be consumed by Tool A). For example, if you
      move the cursor in Tool A, the location change is reflected in Tool B. Conversely, if you
      move the cursor in Tool B, the location change is reflected in Tool A.</P>

        tools.&nbsp;</P>

        <P><IMG border="0" src="../../shared/tip.png"> The manual connection
        is useful only if you want to control specific events between the tools. From the
        <I>Connect Tools</I> dialog, the easiest way to connect all tools for all events is to
        click on the <B>Connect All</B> button. This action will connect tools in both directions,
        just as though you had dragged and dropped the tool icons to do the <A href=
        "#AutomaticToolConnection">automatic connection</A>.&nbsp; Conversely, disconnect all tools
        for all events by clicking on the <B><FONT size="4">Disconnect All</FONT></B> button.</P>

        <OL>
          <LI>Because of the basic premise of connections, connected Tools should have the same
          program <A href=
          "help/topics/ProgramManagerPlugin/Opening_Program_Files.htm">opened</A>.&nbsp; For
          example, tracking program locations between two tools each showing a different program
          will probably not be very useful.</LI>

          <LI>Tools running in different <A href="Ghidra_Front_end.htm#Workspace">workspaces</A>
          may be connected. Even though tools may not be visible because they are not in your
          active workspace, they can still be connected to tools that are running in other
          workspaces.</LI>
