    <P>Auto Analysis watches for changes to the program, such as <A href=
    "help/topics/DisassemblerPlugin/Disassembly.htm">disassembling</A> a new area of memory or
    definition of a function. When a change is noticed, it kicks off Auto Analyzer plugins
    interested in the change. Auto Analyzer plugins evaluate the changes and may decide to make
    further changes to the program. Any changes an Analyzer makes to the program may cause
    additional Analyzers to run. An example chain of auto analysis might be:</P>

    <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images/AutoAnalysis.png"></P>

        <LI>The user triggers disassembly</LI>

        <LI>Function Analyzer - looks at all calls and creates Functions</LI>

        <LI>Stack Analyzer - looks at all new functions and builds a stack based on stack
        references</LI>

        <LI>Operand Analyzer - looks at scalar operands for possible address references</LI>

        <LI>Data Reference Analyzer - looks at references for possible strings or pointers to
        code. References to code are disassembled.<BR>
         .....The cycle repeats with 2) as additional code is disassembled.</LI>
      </OL>

      <P>One program change might cause several Analyzers to become active, however only one
      Analyzer is run at a time. Each Analyzer has a run priority. For instance, the Operand
      Analyzer will always run before the Data Reference Analyzer because the operand analyzer
      could create new references that the Data Reference Analyzer would need to analyze.</P>

      <P>Auto Analyzers normally change the program only if the Analyzer can be certain the change
      is correct. For instance creating a function at the destination of a call is a fairly safe
      bet. Randomly looking for undefined data that could be disassembled where there are no actual
      code references would not be a good idea.</P>

        pre-identified valid strings. This analyzer runs at a very low priority.</P>

          potential string, (b) do not share the same starting address as the potential string, (c)
          share the same ending address as the potential string, and (d) are the same datatype as
          the potential string to be created).</LI>

          <LI><B>Create Strings Containing References</B> - if checked, strings that contain, but
          do not start with, one or more references will be created.</LI>

          <LI><B>Force Model Reload</B> - if checked, forces the model to be reloaded every time
          the analyzer is run (in cases where the user wishes to see the effect of changing a model
          without restarting Ghidra).</LI>

          <LI><B>Minimum String Length</B> - specifies the smallest number of characters in a
          string for it to be considered a valid string. For this analyzer, null termination
          characters are ignored for the purposes of counting characters. Note that smaller numbers
          will result in a larger number of false positives. String length must be at least 4.</LI>

          <LI><B>Model File</B> - Specifies the model file built using the BuildStringModels class
          (default is 'StringModel.sng'). Note that the location of the model file does not need to
          be specified, as models should always be placed in the
          <CODE CLASS="path">&lt;GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/Ghidra/Features/Base/data/stringngrams/</CODE> directory.</LI>

          <LI><B>Require Null Termination for String</B> - if checked, only null-terminated strings
          are created.</LI>

          <LI><B>Search Only in Accessible Memory Blocks</B> - if checked, searches only in memory
          blocks that have at least one of the Read (R), Write (W), or Execute (X) permissions set
          to true. Enabling this option ensures strings are not created in areas such as non-loaded 
          overlays or debug sections.</LI>

          <LI><B>String End Alignment</B> - specifies the byte alignment requirement for the end of
          the string. An alignment of 1 means the string can end at any address. Alignments greater
          than 1 require that (a) the 'require null termination' option be enabled, and (b) if the
          null-terminated string does not end at an aligned boundary, that there exist enough
          trailing '0' bytes following the string to allow alignment. If neither (a) nor (b) apply,
          end alignment is not enforced.</LI>

          <LI><B>String Start Alignment</B> - specifies the byte alignment requirement for the
          start of the string. An alignment of 1 means that strings can start at any address. An
          alignment of 2 means that strings must start on an even address. An alignment of 4 means
          that strings must start on an address that is a multiple of 4.</LI>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>This analyzer works only against the MIPS R4000 processor. It looks at multiple
        instructions to discover references that are put together by multiple instructions. Since
        the R4000 is a RISC processor and each instruction is only 32 bits wide, many references
        must be created by multiple instructions.</P>

        <P>It will also look for certain types of switch or jump tables and automatically create a
        jump table.</P>

        <P>It will also look for "bcctr" type switch statements and automatically create a switch
        table including references.</P>

        <P>Creates a function at each destination of a call instruction. If the destination would

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The Windows x86 PE Analyzers analyze a Windows PE program for MS Visual Studio data
        structures and code. They currently attempt to identify RTTI structures, virtual function
        tables, and exception handling code. One also analyzes the external functions and attempts
        to propagate the data types associated with the parameters.<BR>

        <P>These analyzers only run on PE programs.<BR>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>This analyzer runs at the lowest priority after there are no other analyzers needing to
        run. It looks at undefined bytes to see if code were disassembled at the start of an area
        it would form a valid subroutine. There can be no invalid instructions, and the subroutine
        must not "flow" into any existing code.</P>

        <P>Needless to say this analyzer will not work well on every program, but on some it finds
        all code with no mistakes. Your mileage may vary. There's always undo...</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>This analyzer searches the program for all specified filler bytes and collapses them.
        Some examples of filler bytes are: 0, 00, 90, cc. If you do not specify a certain byte
        pattern to search for then the default will be used. The default is the word <I>Auto</I>
        and it will allow the program to determine the best value to use based on the greatest
        count. You also have the option to change the minimum number of bytes to collapse. The
        default for this is 1.</P>
