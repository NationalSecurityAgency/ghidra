// This file describes a compact representation for disassembled binaries. It is
// loosely based on the PostgreSQL database schema used by BinNavi's
// postgresql_tables.sql (https://git.io/vzlYw).
// It is the output format for the BinExport IDA plugin and the BinDetego
// disassembler and consumed by the BinDiff comparison engine.

// The representation is generic to accommodate various source architectures.
// In particular 32 and 64 bit versions of x86, ARM, PowerPC and MIPS have been
// tested.
//
// Multiple levels of deduping have been applied to make the format more compact
// and avoid redundant data duplication. Some of this due to hard-earned
// experience trying to cope with intentionally obfuscated malicious binaries.
// Note in particular that the same instruction may occur in multiple basic
// blocks and the same basic block in multiple functions (instruction and basic
// block sharing). Implemented naively, malware can use this to cause
// combinatorial explosion in memory usage, DOSing the analyst. This format
// should store every unique expression, mnemonic, operand, instruction and
// basic block only once instead of duplicating the information for every
// instance of it.
//
// This format does _not_ try to be 100% backwards compatible with the old
// version. In particular, we do not store IDA's comment types, making lossless
// porting of IDA comments impossible. We do however, store comments and
// expression substitutions, so porting the actual data is possible, just not
// the exact IDA type.
//
// While it would be more natural to use addresses when defining call graph and
// flow graph edges and other such references, it is more efficient to employ
// one more level of indirection and use indices into the basic block or
// function arrays instead. This is because addresses will usually use most of
// the available 64 bit space while indices will be much smaller and compress
// much better (less randomly distributed).
//
// We omit all fields that are set to their default value anyways. Note that
// this has two side effects:
//   - changing the defaults in this proto file will, in effect, change what's
//     read from disk
//   - the generated code has_* methods are somewhat less useful
// WARNING: We omit the defaults manually in the code writing the data. Do not
//          change the defaults here without changing the code!
//
// TODO(cblichmann): Link flow graphs to call graph nodes. The connection is
//                   there via the address, but tricky to extract.
