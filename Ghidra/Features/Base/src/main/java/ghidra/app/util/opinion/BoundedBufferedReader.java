	 * This method implements the general contract of the corresponding
	 * <code>{@link Reader#read(char[], int, int) read}</code> method of the
	 * <code>{@link Reader}</code> class. As an additional convenience, it
	 * attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking
	 * the <code>read</code> method of the underlying stream. This iterated
	 * <code>read</code> continues until one of the following conditions becomes
	 * true:
	 * <ul>
	 * 
	 * <li>The specified number of characters have been read,</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>The <code>read</code> method of the underlying stream returns
	 * <code>-1</code>, indicating end-of-file, or</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>The <code>ready</code> method of the underlying stream returns
	 * <code>false</code>, indicating that further input requests would block.</li>
	 * 
	 * </ul>
	 * If the first <code>read</code> on the underlying stream returns
	 * <code>-1</code> to indicate end-of-file then this method returns
	 * <code>-1</code>. Otherwise this method returns the number of characters
	 * actually read.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to attempt to
	 * read as many characters as possible in the same fashion.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream's character
	 * buffer, filling it from the underlying stream as necessary. If, however,
	 * the buffer is empty, the mark is not valid, and the requested length is
	 * at least as large as the buffer, then this method will read characters
	 * directly from the underlying stream into the given array. Thus redundant
	 * <code>BufferedReader</code>s will not copy data unnecessarily.
	 * 
	 * @param cbuf
