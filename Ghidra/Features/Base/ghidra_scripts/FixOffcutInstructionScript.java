// This script looks for offcut instruction(s) in the current selection or location and
// automatically fixes "safe" offcuts. This script is suitable for correcting polyglot instruction
// executable size optimizations, LOCK prefix issues, and offcut code used for code obfuscation.
//
// Offcuts are determined to be safe if they don't have additional conflicting offcuts in the same
// base instruction.
// The new instruction length override will be set by assuming there actually is an instruction at
// the safe offcut reference. If a failure to flow this instruction occurs the script will emit
// a warning about the exception and continue processing.
// A check is done for pseudo-disassembly viability before setting the instruction or flowing
// the code so these exceptions shouldn't be reached.
//
// When fixups are applied any existing Error level bookmarks for the Bad Instruction will be
// removed and replaced with info that an offcut was fixed. These can be interpreted that
// assumptions were made about the context flowed locally to the fixed instruction that should be
// taken as fact cautiously since the binary is already confirmed to be well behaved, that is
// strictly flowed.
