//
//   Attempt to detect defined functions in a program that don't return.
//   Functions like exit(), abort(), bassert() don't return, and sometimes
//   compilers know this.  They will start the next function or data immediately
//   after the call to the function that is known not to return.
//   This can cause bad disassembly, incestuous functions, etc...
//
//   This script finds functions that don't return by looking at the code that
//   follows all function calls.
//   Once the no-return usage is detected, it marks the offending functions, and
//   everywhere they are called, changes the fallthru of the call.
//   Then each function that had a fixed up call, re-detect the functions body.
//
//   No code, or bad disassembly marks are cleared.
//
//   You can run this script once, and it will add bookmarks at each potential non-returning
//   function, and at each location that calls the function in a suspicious way.
