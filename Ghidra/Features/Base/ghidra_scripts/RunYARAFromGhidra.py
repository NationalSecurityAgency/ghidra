# This Ghidra script runs YARA on the file associated with the current program in the Ghidra Code Browser.
# The user supplies a YARA rule file.  Upon a match, the YARA rule name is reported in the comment at
# the memory address corresponding to the YARA-provided file offset.
# If 'yara' (Linux/OS X) or 'yara64.exe' (Windows) is not on $PATH, then the user is prompted to locate the YARA executable.
# A dropdown box asks the user to locate the binary that YARA will scan.  The two possible conditions are:
# 1. This Ghidra script runs YARA on the file at the same location as when it was imported
# or a on the file that the user has since moved to a new location.
# 2. The user has imported the file into Ghidra and the user has since deleted the file.  This Ghidra script attempts to
# generate the original bytes of the imported file and asks the user to provide a filename to store the bytes.  YARA then runs on that file.
