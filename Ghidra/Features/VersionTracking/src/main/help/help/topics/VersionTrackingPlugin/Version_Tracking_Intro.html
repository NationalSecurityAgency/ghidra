        Version Tracking refers to the process used by reverse engineers to identify matching code or data 
        between different software binaries.  One common use case is to version track two 
        different versions of the same binary.  Alternatively, version tracking techniques 
        can be used to check for the presence of of a particular piece of code within a given 
        binary of interest.       
        </P>
        
        <P>        
        Perhaps the most common version tracking scenario is when you have a binary file that 
        you have previously analyzed, identifying important areas of interest and annotating the code with comments
        and labels.  Suppose the software developer releases a newer version of the software including bug 
        fixes and feature modifications.  Since customers may be using the more up-to-date version,
        the analyst will probably want to continue evaluation with the newer version as well.
        However, it can be very time-consuming to have to initiate the analysis from scratch. In
        order to leverage the existing work, version tracking enables the reverse engineer 
        to port comments and labels into the new context.        
        </P>
        
        <P>
        Perhaps the second most common version tracking scenario is where you wish to check for
        the presence of existing code within a given binary.  As an example, given a small collection 
        of functions, say from some library of routines or code representing known malware, you 
        can use version tracking to search for that code in a given binary.
        </P>

	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	  
	   <P>
	   A <i>session</i> is created as a result of running one of Ghidra's matching 
	   algorithms (a.k.a., a <a href="#Intro_Correlators">correlator</a>) against two binaries. 
	   The newly created session is stored in the 
	   <a href="help/topics/FrontEndPlugin/Ghidra_Front_end.htm#Project_Window">Ghidra Project Window</a>.
	   The session records the history of any work done within that session (e.g., applying 
	   markup).  Furthermore, since changes are saved, you may close and reopen a session to 
	   continue work at a later time.  Sessions can be updated with new data by running 
	   additional matching algorithms at any time.

	<H2><A name="Intro_Associations"></A>Version Tracking Associations</H2>
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>
        
		An <I>association</I> is any pairing of information between the two versions of the same program, which suggests 
		that the items correspond with one another in some way.  An association is characterized by a collection
		of metadata including the correlating algorithm that determined the association, a memory address reference
		locating the items in each version, and the type of the items being associated (data or function).		
		</P>

	    <P>	
		Sometimes a variable or function in the source program will be associated with several
		variables or functions in the destination program.  This happens because the version tracking algorithm has
		found enough evidence to support each candidate as a possible correspondence between the two versions.  When
		this happens, we say that they are conflicting associations.  It may be that only one of the associations
		is exactly right or that the modularity of the program has changed sufficiently and none of the associations
		is quite right.  Ultimately, the analyst has to inspect the actual code
		to make a determination about which associations represents a valid match.		
		</P>
		
	    <P>	    
		Once an association is accepted by the user, any other associations which may be conflicting because they include
		either the same source or the same destination address will become blocked because the tool only allows one-to-one
		mappings.  Blocked and conflicting associations which lead to other inconsistencies can be a useful way of identifying 
		valid matches between two different versions.  
		
        </P>

	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>
        A <i>match</i> is an association that has been assigned a score.  As a correlator finds an 
        association it will assign that association a score, thus creating a match.  The
        <a href="help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/providers/VT_Matches_Table.html">matches table</a>
        contains all matches discovered by any correlators run within a given session.  Users 
        can use the score to help determine the accuracy of a given match, as not all matches
        created by the correlators are correct.		
		</P>
		
		<P>
		When the you determine that a match is valid, then you can 
		<a href="help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/providers/VT_Matches_Table.html#Accept_Match">accept</a>
		the match, which will block conflicting, related matches.  When you apply markup for a
		given match, then that match is automatically accepted.  Finally, you cannot apply
		markup for a match that has been blocked by another already accepted match.
		</P>
		
		<P>		
		Ghidra also has the concept of an 
		<a href="help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/providers/VT_Implied_Matches_Table.html#Implied_Matches">Implied 
		Match</a>.  If you accept a function match, then Ghidra will generate implied matches for any functions
		called by the two functions that make up the function match.

      <H2><A name="Intro_Markup_Items"></A>Version Tracking Markup Items</H2>
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>
        
		During analysis of a program, the analyst will develop a greater understanding of the code and will annotate
		the disassembly with comments, labels, data type information, and parameter and variable names to document 
		the code and to make it more readable.  Ghidra refers to all of these annotated details
		as markup items.
		
		</P>
		<P>
		For any given match we can apply its markup items
		and port these annotations in an appropriate manner so that the labels and comments appear in the corresponding
		locations in the new binary.  This is the ultimate purpose of version tracking, to retain any progress that
		has already been made in understanding the code and be able to proceed despite any changes 
		to the original binary.

	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>
		
		There are many strategies for identifying 
		how different versions of the a program are related to each other.  Any scheme or algorithm 
		that determines these relationships is referred to as a correlator.  Correlators may be based 
		on the underlying bytes in a program, the program flow, or any other aspect of the code upon
		which similarities may be observed.  Additional documentation is available for the specific
		<a href="help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/VT_Correlators.html">correlators used in Ghidra.</a>
