	      <P>The Version Tracking Matches Table is the primary window for managing a version tracking
	      session.  It displays a list of all matches contained in the current session.  All other
	      version tracking windows are driven by selecting a match within this table.  This window
	      is also the primary means for accepting matches and bulk applying markup items. In addition,
	      this table provides an extensive filtering system. </P>

	      <P>A match represents an opinion that a function or data in one program is the equivalent
	      function or data in another program.  The pairing of a function or data from one program to
	      another is called an association. There can be multiple matches (opinions) for the same
	      association by one or more correlation algorithms.  When a match is considered correct, it
	      should be marked as accepted.  When a match is marked as accepted, it is really the 
	      association that is accepted and therefore all matches that have the same association are
	      considered accepted. Also, when a match is accepted, all competing matches (matches that have
	      the same source or destination address, but not both) become blocked.  For example, if one
	      match has the opinion that A in one program is associated with X in another program and
	      another match has the opinion that A is associated with Y, then accepting the first match,
	      will block the second match since A can't be associated with both X and Y.</P>

	      	As of Ghidra 11.2, Version Tracking supports deleting matches.  Any match that has
	      	not been accepted can be deleted without confirmation.   However, if you attempt to 
	      	delete an <B>accepted match</B> that is the <B>last match for an association</B>, then 
	      	you will be prompted to confirm your decision.
	      	</P>
	      	<P>
	      	Generally, we suggest users should not delete accepted matches for the following reasons:
	      	<ul>
	      	<li>Accepted matches are used by some of the other correlators to find more matches. If
	      	completely deleted, those other correlators will not have as much information to work 
	      	from. </li>
	      	<li>The number of implied match votes and conflicts will be altered when accepted 
	      	matches are completely removed.</li>
	      	<li>If deleting an accepted match causes the number of votes to reach
	      	zero for a particular implied match, the implied match will be deleted as well. </li>
	      	<li>Selecting an accepted match in the match table allows users to see what markup was
	      	applied when the match was accepted. Deleting accepted matches while keeping applied 
 			markup will remove this supporting evidence regarding how the markup was generated.</li>

	      		<P><IMG src="help/shared/tip.png">An alternative to deleting matches is to

	      	<P>
	      	<U>To keep all applied markup</U>, simply delete the match and, when
	      	prompted, choose <B>Delete Accepted Matches</B>.  This choice will delete the match and
	      	its markup items, but <B>any applied markup item content will remain in the destination 
	      	program.</B>  Alternatively, when prompted, you can choose <B>Finish</B> which will 
	      	close the prompt dialog and will not delete the remaining accepted matches or markup.

	      	<A HREF="#Clear_Match">clear</A> the match before executing the remove action.  The clear
