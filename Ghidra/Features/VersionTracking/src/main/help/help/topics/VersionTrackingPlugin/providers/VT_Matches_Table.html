	      <P>The Version Tracking Matches Table is the primary window for managing a version tracking
	      session.  It displays a list of all matches contained in the current session.  All other
	      version tracking windows are driven by selecting a match within this table.  This window
	      is also the primary means for accepting matches and bulk applying markup items. In addition,
	      this table provides an extensive filtering system. </P>

	      <P>A match represents an opinion that a function or data in one program is the equivalent
	      function or data in another program.  The pairing of a function or data from one program to
	      another is called an association. There can be multiple matches (opinions) for the same
	      association by one or more correlation algorithms.  When a match is considered correct, it
	      should be marked as accepted.  When a match is marked as accepted, it is really the 
	      association that is accepted and therefore all matches that have the same association are
	      considered accepted. Also, when a match is accepted, all competing matches (matches that have
	      the same source or destination address, but not both) become blocked.  For example, if one
	      match has the opinion that A in one program is associated with X in another program and
	      another match has the opinion that A is associated with Y, then accepting the first match,
	      will block the second match since A can't be associated with both X and Y.</P>
