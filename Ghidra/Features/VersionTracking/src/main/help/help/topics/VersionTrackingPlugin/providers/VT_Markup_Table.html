			<P>
	      	<i>Marking up</i> a program means adding information to a program to help understand it. 
	      	A markup item is some type of information that has been specified in the source program 
	      	that you now wish to move to the equivalent function or data within the destination program. 
	      	The Version Tracking Markup Items table shows a list of markup items for the currently 
	      	selected match in the <A href="VT_Matches_Table.html#Matches_Table">Version Tracking Matches table</A>. 
	      	</P>
	      	<P>Below the Markup Items table you can also view two listings, 
	      	one for the source program and the other for the destination program. The dual listings 
	      	provide an alternate way, besides the table, to view and manipulate the markup items. 
	      	This also provides the capability to drag a markup item from the source program and apply it, 
	      	where you want, by dropping it in the destination program. 
	      	The <A href="#Dual_Listing">dual listing</A> will be described below in more detail.
	      	</P>

				Once you have decided that you believe a function or data match is correct, 
				the Markup Items table allows you to decide whether you want to apply or ignore 
				individual markup items. Applying a markup item changes the information in the
				destination program using information from the source program. The Markup Items table
				lets you decide what to apply from the source program to the destination program 
				and how to apply it.

				        		An undefined data type of a particular size will not replace a defined data type.
				        		A defined data type can replace any other data type, but will not if
				        		the option is set to "Replace Undefined Data Types Only" and the 
				        		destination is a defined data type.

				        		parameter name in the destination program.
				        		<br>
				        		If you choose to do a "Priority Replace" for the parameter names,
				        		whether or not the name is replaced depends on their source types.
				        		The options let you choose whether User Defined names or Imported
				        		names are higher priority. You can also specify whether the source 
				        		name should replace the destination whenever their source types are the same.

					  			The background colors in the listings are used to identify where you have markup items.
					  			The colors are also used to indicate the status of each markup item.
					  			For example a green background indicates markup items that have already been applied, 
					  			orange indicates markup that is still unapplied, 
					  			blue indicates a markup item where the source and destination already match,
					  			grey indicates a markup item you have chosen to ignore,
					  			pink indicates a markup item you have rejected,
					  			and red indicates a markup item where an attempt to apply the item to the destination failed.

						<BR>
				        <H3><A name="Markup_Item_Drag_And_Drop"></A>Drag and Drop</H3>
					  		    <P>
					  			You can use drag and drop in the dual listing window to apply markup items. 
					  			This provides a quick visual way to apply a particular markup item to a specific 
					  			spot in the destination listing. If the address correlator has associated the 
					  			incorrect destination address with the markup item's source address or if the correlator 
					  			couldn't determine a destination address, you can quickly apply an item by dragging 
					  			it to the correct address in the destination listing. Manually editing the destination 
					  			address and then applying the item is more time consuming, but can be done instead 
					  			of using drag and drop.
					  			Drag and drop of markup items isn't available from the separate Source and Destination Tools
					  			because dragging begins selection of code there.
					  			</P>
					  			<P>
					  			Drag and drop is available for all markup items in the dual listing where it makes 
					  			sense to apply a markup item. For example, you can't drag an already applied markup item.
					  			To apply an item, click on the markup item in the source listing you 
					  			want to apply and drag it to the code in the destination listing where you want it applied.
					  			When you start dragging, the cursor will change to indicate that dragging is allowed
					  			for the item. Once you drop the item, the destination listing will update to show 
					  			the markup where it was dropped, the background color will change, and the markup 
					  			item's status should change in the table.
					  			</P>
					  			<P>
					  			<img src="help/shared/note.png"/> Some markup item's can only be applied at a 
					  			particular spot. For example, a function's
					  			name or signature can only be applied to the function. Therefore the destination
					  			function's entry point is the expected destination address. In this case, the destination
					  			address will become the destination function's entry point no matter where you drop 
					  			the markup item in the destination listing.
					  			</P>
