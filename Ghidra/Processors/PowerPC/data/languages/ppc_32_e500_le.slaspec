# SLA specification file for IBM PowerPC e500 series core

# NOTE: This language variant includes some registers and instructions not supported
# by the actual processor (e.g., floating pointer registers and associated instructions).
# The actual processor only supports a subset of the registers and instructions implemented.

# Although a 32-bit architecture, 64-bit general purpose registers are supported. 
# Language has been modeled using a 64-bit implementation with a 32-bit truncated 
# memory space (see ldefs).
