  <body><h1>WebAssembly</h1>

<p>Module to load WebAssembly files into Ghidra, supporting disassembly and decompilation.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for all WebAssembly 1.0 opcodes</li>
<li>Cross-references for function calls and branches</li>
<li>Cross-references for table entries and globals containing function pointers</li>
<li>Recovery of the C stack, when the stack pointer is stored in a global variable (typical for compilers like Emscripten)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many Wasm programs, especially those compiled by Emscripten or Clang, use a
global variable to store the C stack pointer. This module will attempt to
automatically detect the C stack pointer during analysis; if it fails, you may
need to set it yourself before performing initial analysis by setting the "C
Stack Pointer" in the Wasm Pre-Analyzer settings.</li>
<li>By default, the C stack is assumed to grow in the negative direction, i.e.
towards smaller addresses. However, compilers are actually free to choose either
stack direction, and both positive and negative-growing stacks have been
observed in real-world samples. If your C stack grows upwards (e.g. indicated by
an add operation to the C stack pointer in the function prologue rather than a
subtract), select the <code>pos-stack</code> compiler when importing the file, or via <code>Set
Language...</code> on an existing file in the project window.</li>
<li>Emscripten will usually translate function pointer calls into calls to
exported <code>dyncall_</code> functions, which take a call-type-specific index as the
first parameter. The index is used to index a sub-section of the main function
table (table0) to find the function to call. The included script
<code>analyze_dyncalls.py</code> can analyze the <code>dyncall_</code> functions, extract the indices,
and rename referenced functions according to their call type and function index
(which will often serve as function pointer values in memory). This can be used
to resolve function pointer references, for example.</li>
<li>Element segments may be passive, or have offset expressions that depend on
imported globals. In this case, the element segments are not automatically
loaded to the table. You can manually load these segments by calling
<code>WasmLoader.loadElementsToTable</code>. For example, to load element segment #0 to
table #0 at offset 0 in Python:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">from wasm import WasmLoader
from wasm.analysis import WasmAnalysis
from ghidra.util.task import ConsoleTaskMonitor
monitor = ConsoleTaskMonitor()
WasmLoader.loadElementsToTable(currentProgram, WasmAnalysis.getState(currentProgram).module, 0, 0, 0, monitor)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, data segments can be manually loaded as well. For example, to load
data segment #5 to memory #0 at offset 0x1000, do the following in Python:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">from wasm import WasmLoader
from wasm.analysis import WasmAnalysis
from ghidra.util.task import ConsoleTaskMonitor
monitor = ConsoleTaskMonitor()
WasmLoader.loadDataToMemory(currentProgram, WasmAnalysis.getState(currentProgram).module, 5, 0, 0x1000, monitor)
</code></pre>
<h2>Emulation</h2>
<p>This module supports emulation of Wasm code using the standard Ghidra emulation
framework, i.e. via <code>EmulatorHelper</code>, <code>Emulator</code> and <code>Emulate</code>.</p>
<p>Stack frames for inactive function frames (locals, Wasm stack variables, and the
return address) are stored on a shadow stack, which begins at the <code>ss0</code> register
and grows towards higher addresses in the register space.</p>
<p>The <code>emulate_writev.py</code> script demonstrates emulation with hooking of the
Emscripten <code>__syscall3</code> function in order to process <code>writev</code> calls.</p>
<h2>Limitations and Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently, inlining functions (via marking them "In Line") is not supported
and will confuse the decompiler. This is because the inlined function's
references to stack and local variables will affect the caller. I tried to solve
this limitation by injecting code to save and restore stack and locals on
function entry/exit, but ran into a Ghidra limitation - the decompiler does not
inject "uponentry" Pcode into inlined functions.</li>
<li>Currently, there is no way to change the C stack pointer after initial analysis
(attempting to re-analyze the program with a new C stack pointer will not change
anything).</li>
<li>Initial analysis and disassembly can be very slow. This is primarily because
Ghidra is quite slow at setting large numbers of context registers.</li>
<li>Multiple return values are untested and will probably not work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Internals</h2>
<p>This module uses a pre-analyzer (WasmPreAnalyzer) to analyze all functions and
opcodes, providing contextual information to the SLEIGH disassembler to enable
correct disassembly (for example, operand sizes when they depend on the types in
the value stack, branch target addresses, etc). In order to support recovery of
the C stack, this module converts Wasm stack operations into operations on a
register file. This frees up the decompiler's stack analysis to focus on the
behaviour of the C stack, since the decompiler only supports a single stack.
Additionally, parameter passing and returns are handled by virtual input/output
registers which are copied to/from the stack and locals registers via Pcode
injection.</p>
<p>Four different types of "registers" are defined: input (iN), output (oN), stack
(sN) and locals (lN). Of these, only the locals will be visible in the
disassembly; stack registers will appear in the PCode, and input/output
registers will appear in function types.</p>
