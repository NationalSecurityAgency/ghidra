<p>
  This document describes the syntax for the SLEIGH processor
  specification language, which was developed for the GHIDRA
  project. The language that is now called SLEIGH has undergone
  several redesign iterations, but it can still trace its heritage
  from the language SLED, from whom its name is derived. SLED, the
  &#8220;Specification Language for Encoding and Decoding&#8221;, was defined by
  Norman Ramsey and Mary F. Fernandez as a concise way to define the
  translation, in both directions, between machine instructions and
  their corresponding assembly statements. This facilitated the
  development of architecture independent disassemblers and
  assemblers, such as the New Jersey Machine-code Toolkit.
</p>
<p>
  The direct predecessor of SLEIGH was an implementation of SLED for
  GHIDRA, which concentrated on its reverse-engineering
  capabilities. The main addition of SLEIGH is the ability to provide
  semantic descriptions of instructions for data-flow and
  decompilation analysis. This piece of SLEIGH was originally a
  separate language, the Semantic Syntax Language (SSL), very loosely
  based on concepts and a language of the same name developed by
  Cristina Cifuentes, Mike Van Emmerik and Norman Ramsey, for the
  University of Queensland Binary Translator (UQBT) project.

<a name="idm140310875632160"></a>Overview</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
SLEIGH is a language for describing the instruction sets of general
purpose microprocessors, in order to facilitate the reverse
engineering of software written for them. SLEIGH was designed for the
GHIDRA reverse engineering platform and is used to describe
microprocessors with enough detail to facilitate two major components
of GHIDRA, the disassembly and decompilation engines. For disassembly,
SLEIGH allows a concise description of the translation from the bit
encoding of machine instructions to human-readable assembly language
statements. Moreover, it does this with enough detail to allow the
disassembly engine to break apart the statement into the mnemonic,
operands, sub-operands, and associated syntax. For decompilation,
SLEIGH describes the translation from machine instructions into
<span class="emphasis"><em>p-code</em></span>. P-code is a Register Transfer Language
(RTL), distinct from SLEIGH, designed to specify
the <span class="emphasis"><em>semantics</em></span> of machine instructions. By
<span class="emphasis"><em>semantics</em></span>, we mean the detailed description of
how an instruction actually manipulates data, in registers and in
RAM. This provides the foundation for the data-flow analysis performed
by the decompiler.
</p>
<p>
A SLEIGH specification typically describes a single microprocessor and
is contained in a single file. The term <span class="emphasis"><em>processor</em></span>
will always refer to this target of the specification.
</p>
<p>
Italics are used when defining terms and for named entities. Bold is used for SLEIGH keywords.

<a name="idm140310875627168"></a>1. Introduction to P-Code</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
Although p-code is a distinct language from SLEIGH, because a major
purpose of SLEIGH is to specify the translation from machine code to
p-code, this document serves as a primer for p-code. The key concepts
and terminology are presented in this section, and more detail is
given in <a class="xref" href="sleigh_constructors.html#sleigh_semantic_section" title="7.7. The Semantic Section">Section 7.7, &#8220;The Semantic Section&#8221;</a>. There is also a complete set
of tables which list syntax and descriptions for p-code operations in
the Appendix.
</p>
<p>
The design criteria for p-code was to have a language that looks much
like modern assembly instruction sets but capable of modeling any
general purpose processor. Code for different processors can be
translated in a straightforward manner into p-code, and then a single
suite of analysis software can be used to do data-flow analysis and
decompilation. In this way, the analysis software
becomes <span class="emphasis"><em>retargetable</em></span>, and it isn&#8217;t necessary to
redesign it for each new processor being analyzed. It is only
necessary to specify the translation of the processor&#8217;s instruction
set into p-code.
</p>
<p>
So the key properties of p-code are

</ul></div></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
SLEIGH is the language which specifies the translation from a machine
instruction to p-code. It specifies both this translation and how to
display the instruction as an assembly statement.
</p>
<p>
A model for a particular processor is built out of three concepts:
the <span class="emphasis"><em>address space</em></span>,
the <span class="emphasis"><em>varnode</em></span>, and
the <span class="emphasis"><em>operation</em></span>. These are generalizations of the
computing concepts of RAM, registers, and machine instructions
respectively.
</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140310875617744"></a>1.1. Address Spaces</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
An <span class="emphasis"><em>address</em></span> space for p-code is a generalization of
the indexed memory (RAM) that a typical processor has access to, and
it is defined simply as an indexed sequence of
memory <span class="emphasis"><em>words</em></span> that can be read and written by
p-code. In almost all cases, a <span class="emphasis"><em>word</em></span> of the space
is a <span class="emphasis"><em>byte</em></span> (8 bits), and we will usually use the
term <span class="emphasis"><em>byte</em></span> instead
of <span class="emphasis"><em>word</em></span>. However, see the discussion of
the <span class="bold"><strong>wordsize</strong></span> attribute of address
spaces below.
</p>
<p>
The defining characteristics of a space are its name and its size. The
size of a space indicates the number of distinct indices into the
space and is usually given as the number of bytes required to encode
an arbitrary index into the space. A space of size 4 requires a 32 bit
integer to specify all indices and contains
2<sup>32</sup> bytes. The index of a byte is usually
referred to as the <span class="emphasis"><em>offset</em></span>, and the offset
together with the name of the space is called
the <span class="emphasis"><em>address</em></span> of the byte.
</p>
<p>
Any manipulation of data that p-code operations perform happens in
some address space. This includes the modeling of data stored in RAM
but also includes the modeling of processor registers. Registers must
be modeled as contiguous sequences of bytes at a specific offset (see
the definition of varnodes below), typically in their own distinct
address space. In order to facilitate the modeling of many different
processors, a SLEIGH specification provides complete control over what
address spaces are defined and where registers are located within
them.
</p>
<p>
Typically, a processor can be modeled with only two spaces,
a <span class="emphasis"><em>ram</em></span> address space that represents the main
memory accessible to the processor via its data-bus, and
a <span class="emphasis"><em>register</em></span> address space that is used to
implement the processor&#8217;s registers. However, the specification
designer can define as many address spaces as needed.
</p>
<p>
There is one address space that is automatically defined for a SLEIGH
specification. This space is used to allocate temporary storage when
the SLEIGH compiler breaks down the expressions describing processor
semantics into individual p-code operations. It is called
the <span class="emphasis"><em>unique</em></span> space. There is also a special address
space, called the <span class="emphasis"><em>const</em></span> space, used as a
placeholder for constant operands of p-code instructions. For the most
part, a SLEIGH specification doesn&#8217;t need to be aware of this space,
but it can be used in certain situations to force values to be
interpreted as constants.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sleigh_varnodes"></a>1.2. Varnodes</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
A <span class="emphasis"><em>varnode</em></span> is the unit of data manipulated by
p-code. It is simply a contiguous sequence of bytes in some address
space. The two defining characteristics of a varnode are
</p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: bullet; ">
<li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">
  The address of the first byte.
  </li>
<li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">
  The number of bytes (size).
  </li>
</ul></div></div>
<p>
With the possible exception of constants treated as varnodes, there is
never any distinction made between one varnode and another. They can
have any size, they can overlap, and any number of them can be
defined.
</p>
<p>
Varnodes by themselves are typeless. An individual p-code operation
forces an interpretation on each varnode that it uses, as either an
integer, a floating-point number, or a boolean value. In the case of
an integer, the varnode is interpreted as having a big endian or
little endian encoding, depending on the specification (see
<a class="xref" href="sleigh_definitions.html#sleigh_endianess_definition" title="4.1. Endianess Definition">Section 4.1, &#8220;Endianess Definition&#8221;</a>). Certain instructions
also distinguish between signed and unsigned interpretations. For a
signed integer, the varnode is considered to have a standard twos
complement encoding. For a boolean interpretation, the varnode must be
a single byte in size. In this special case, the zero encoding of the
byte is considered a <span class="emphasis"><em>false</em></span> value and an encoding
of 1 is a <span class="emphasis"><em>true</em></span> value.
</p>
<p>
These interpretations only apply to the varnode for a particular
operation. A different operation can interpret the same varnode in a
different way. Any consistent meaning assigned to a particular varnode
must be provided and enforced by the specification designer.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140310875600592"></a>1.3. Operations</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
P-code is intended to emulate a target processor by substituting a
sequence of p-code operations for each machine instruction. Thus every
p-code operation is naturally associated with the address of a
specific machine instruction, but there is usually more than one
p-code operation associated with a single machine instruction. Except
in the case of branching, p-code operations have fall-through control
flow, both within and across machine instructions. For a single
machine instruction, the associated p-code operations execute from
first to last. And if there is no branching, execution picks up with
the first operation corresponding to the next machine instruction.
</p>
<p>
Every p-code operation can take one or more varnodes as input and can
optionally have one varnode as output. The operation can only make a
change to this <span class="emphasis"><em>output varnode</em></span>, which is always indicated
explicitly. Because of this rule, all manipulation of data is
explicit. The operations have no indirect effects. In general, there
is absolutely no restriction on what varnodes can be used as inputs
and outputs to p-code operations. The only exceptions to this are that
constants cannot be used as output varnodes and certain operations
impose restrictions on the <span class="emphasis"><em>size</em></span> of their varnode operands.
</p>
<p>
The actual operations should be familiar to anyone who has studied
general purpose processor instruction sets. They break up into groups.
