### Notable API Changes
* _API_. (GP-5458) `GhidraProject.openProject()` now throws `NotFoundException, NotOwnerException, LockException`.
* _API_. (GP-5591) Removed unused and unsupported `DataType.getDocs()` method.
* _Debugger_. (GP-2040) Deleted `AbstractAsyncServer`, `AsyncClaimQueue`, `AsyncLock`, `AsyncLoop`, `AsyncPairingCache`, `AsyncRace`, `AsyncSequence*`, `BitmaskSet`, `DebugByteChannel`, `TypeSpec` and related, without replacements.
* _Debugger_. (GP-3450) Added `UnwoundFrame.evaluate(Program, Varnode, AddressSetView)`.
* _Debugger_. (GP-5379) Most accessor methods on `TraceUniqueObject` derivatives now require a `snap` argument. For getters, this is the snap for which the value is sought. For setters, this implies the effect is from that snap onward. In most cases, the GUI's current snap is suitable. (The deprecated legacy-mode objects ignore the argument.) This required argument has cascaded throughout many other parts of the API: `DebuggerStaticMappingService`, `AutoMapSpec`, `MapProposal.MapEntry`, `DebuggerStaticMappingService`, `ProgramModuleIndexer`, `DebuggerObjectActionContext`, `DebugerSectionActionContext`, `BreakpointActionSet`, and `*EmuBreakpointActionItem`. Additionally, `getLifespan` and similar, including setters and "split-and-set," have been removed from most `TraceObjectUnique` derivatives. For cases where you need to check if the object is valid at a particular time, use `isValid(long)`. For cases where you need to enumerate (e.g., to plot) the life, use the underlying `TraceObject`. To truncate the life of an object, use `remove(long)`. For `TraceThread` in particular, the destruction snap is now considered part of its life, which is consistent with how every other object has been treated. Connectors should (and already have been) using `remove`, which sets the "destruction snap" to the one preceding the current.
* _Debugger:Agents_. (GP-4209) On the Python side: The ghidratrace package is now type-checked using mypy. As a result, the annotations used for the method registry now use `typing.Annotated` when parameters need additional description. `Client.create_trace()` now also requires a named parameter `extra`. On the Java side: Added `TraceTimeManager.findScratchSnapshot`. The trace-rmi protocol has also changed.
* _Debugger:Agents_. (GP-5538) Powershell is now supported as a debug launcher language on Windows.
* _Debugger:Breakpoints_. (GP-4546) TraceRmi methods with `action="break_ext"` now appear in the new drop-down. TraceRmi methods can now also specify their menu icon, as well as the text for their confirmation button in parameter dialogs. These are the `icon` and `ok_text` attributes, respectively. The `icon` attribute should be the id of an icon given in a theme.properties file.
* _Debugger:dbgeng.dll_. (GP-5678) Added `DebuggerListingService.getAutoReadMemorySpec()`. Moved `AutoReadMemorySpec` into the Debugger-api module. Created `AutoReadMemorySpecFactory` and refactored accordingly.
* _Debugger:Listing_. (GP-616) Added `Trace.getBaseDataTypeManager()` method.  Added `TracePlatform.getDataTypeManager()` method.  Added `TraceBasedDataTypeManager.getPlatform()` method.  `TraceDefinedDataView.create()` now takes optional `platform` argument.  Added `TraceVariableSnapProgramView.setPlatform()` method.  `DebuggerPlatformService.setCurrentMapperFor()` has an additional `focus` parameter.  Most methods in `DebuggerPlatformMapper` now take both `object` and `snap` parameters.  Added `AbstractDebuggerPlatformMapper.getDisassemblyPlatform()` method.  `DbgengX64DisassemblyInject.Mode` and related methods moved to `DbgengDebuggerPlatformOpinion`.
* _Debugger:Listing_. (GP-5548) Added `DebuggerStaticSyncService` interface and its Plugin implementation. Moved `DebuggerOpenProgramActionContext` into API project. Added `DebuggerConsolePlugin.clear()` method.
* _Debugger:Memory_. (GP-3405) Added `TraceHighlightEvent`.
Added `TrackingChangedPluginEvent`.
Added `AbstractLocation/Selection/HighlightPluginEvent`.
* _Debugger:Objects_. (GP-5425) Several protected abstract methods in `AbstractTarget` are removed without replacement. `Target.collectActions` now requires an argument specifying how its object arguments are gathered.
* _Debugger:Stack_. (GP-3771) Added `UnwindInfo.maskOfReturn`.
* _Debugger:Time_. (GP-5523) Added `TimeRadix` class. Added `TraceTimeManager.set/getTimeRadix` methods. `TraceSchedule.toString` and `.parse` methods now accept radix argument. `Span.toString` can now accept custom endpoint formatter.
* _Decompiler_. (GP-5477) Added new methods to the DecompilerHighlightService to allow function-specific highlights.
* _Framework_. (GP-5436) Deleted the Debug/Framework-AsyncComm project/module. Most of its few remaining classes were moved to Framework/Generic.
* _GUI_. (GP-5375) `GTree.forceNewNodeIntoView()` has been replaced by `GTree.whenNodeIsReady()`.
* _ProgramDB_. (GP-5742) Deprecated the use of `int` to indicate a CommentType in favor of the newly created enum.
* _Version Tracking_. (GP-4151) The Dialog Wizard API has been completely rewritten.

# Ghidra 11.3.1 Change History (February 2025)

### Improvements
* _Multi-User_. Allow a repository without an Admin in the ACL to instantiate during server startup.  The `svrAdmin -grant` command line tool may be used to assign a new Admin to a repository.  Currently, when a user is removed from the server they are removed from all repository ACLs which could leave a repository without an Admin which will fail on server startup. (GP-5368)

### Bugs
* _Basic Infrastructure_. Fixed a bug that prevented Ghidra from remembering the last-used JDK when the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable was set. (GP-5381, Issue #7503)
* _Debugger:LLDB_. Fixed an issue with local-lldb.bat. (GP-5347, Issue #4977)

### Notable API Changes
* _Debugger:Agents_. (GP-1978) The entirety of `DebuggerObjectModel` and most of its related paraphernalia have been removed. Other parts have been refactored into other components. `DebuggerObjectModel` / `TraceRecorder` is replaced by `TraceRmi` / `Target`. `TargetObject` is replaced by `TraceObject`. Some `TargetObject` interfaces, e.g., `TargetDeletable`, do not have replacement `TraceObject` interfaces. Instead, they are implied by applicable `RemoteMethods`. Others, e.g., `TargetAccessConditioned`, are removed without replacement.  `DataType`- and `Symbol`-related objects are removed. They have not been used. If needed later, the intent is to provide rmi-based access to the trace's symbol table and data type manager. `TargetObjectSchema` is replaced by `TraceObjectSchema`. `TraceObjectKeyPath` is renamed `KeyPath`. `PathUtils` and many uses of `List<String>` have been replaced by `KeyPath`. `AnnotatedSchemaContext` and related are removed. `SshPtyFactory` and related are removed.
* _Emulator_. (GP-4643) Added `JitPcodeEmulator` and many, many related classes. `PcodeArithmetic`: changed `modBeforeStore` and `modAfterLoad` to include `AddressSpace` and `PcodeOp` parameters.  `SleighInstructionDecoder.decodeInstruction` now returns a `PseudoInstruction`. PcodeExecutor: added `getIntConst`, `getLoadStoreSpace`, `getLoadStoreOffset`, `getStoreValue`, `getBranchTarget`, `getConditionalBranchPredicate`, `getIndirectBranchTarget`, `getUseropName`, `getCallotherOpNumber`.
* _BSim_. (GP-5167) Changed BSim API to convey non-default username via the `BSimServerInfo` class or the `userinfo` field of postgres/elastic BSim URLs.  The user argument has been dropped to the `FunctionDatabase.changePassword` method which will always change the password for the connected user.   Renamed `FunctionDatabase.Error` class to `FunctionDatabase.BSimError` to avoid naming conflict with `java.lang.Error`.
* _Data Types_. (GP-3625) Added `FileDataTypeManager` static methods for creating a Data Type Archive with a specific processor and compiler specification.  Improved `CParserUtils` parse methods to separate the cases where parsing into an existing Data Type Manager versus parsing into a new Data Type Archive where a processor and compiler specification may specified.
* _Debugger:Listing_. (GP-5134) `DebuggerListingProvider#setAutoReadMemorySpec` and related no longer accept `LoadEmulatorAutoReadMemorySpec`. Added `AutoReadMemorySpec#getEffective`.
* _Decompiler_. (GP-5085) Updated `DecompileOptions` to remove the `getFunctionColor()` method. There is no replacement for this method as the function color is now being set in the Listing Settings menu and is coordinated across the Listing and Decompile panes.
* _Demangler_. (GP-4898) Within the `Demangler` interface, Ghidra 9.2-deprecated methods were removed, Ghidra 11.3-deprecations were set on other methods, and  new methods were created.  The new methods and much of the Demangler fabric now makes use of a `MangledContext` in place of a `String`.  This allows greater flexibility in controlling how symbols get demangled.  These changes have been reflected in abstract and non-abstract methods in `AbstractDemanglerAnalzyer`.  Users of deprecated methods within `Demangler` and `DemanglerUtil` should migrate to newer methods (see javadoc).
* _GUI_. (GP-5007) Added a new widget, the `docking.KeyEntryPanel`, as a drop-in replacement for clients using the `docking.KeyEntryTextField`.  This is not a required change.
* _GUI_. (GP-5196) The static method `evaluateToLong(String s)` in `AddressEvaluator` has been moved to a new class called `ExpressionEvaluator`. Also, the `AddressInput` field component has been changed to accept Programs instead of just an AddressFactory (which is still supported) so that any dialog using an `AddressInput` component can now accept symbol names, memory block names, and mathematical expressions.
* _Importer_. (GP-5208) GFileSystems now need to implement `lookup(path, comparator)`.   Classes that fail to provide an implementation will fall back to using `lookup(path)`, and an error will be logged.
* _Search_. (GP-4911) The API script method `findBytes()` no longer supports finding matches that span gaps in the memory blocks. The internal classes for performing memory searches were completely re-written in Ghidra release 11.2. In release 11.3, the old classes were removed and uses of them in the `findBytes()` method were replaced with the new memory search code. The new search API currently does not support matches that span non-contiguous memory and it isn't clear if that is actually useful; so for now, that method was deprecated and no longer finds matches in gaps even if the boolean is true. In the unlikely event someone actually uses this, please contact the Ghidra team.
* _Assembler_. (GP-5288) Added `AssemblyResolvedPatterns.withContext`.  Added `ContextCommit.getWordIndex` and `getMask`.
* _BSim_. (GP-1830) Dropped use of `json-simple` library in favor of `gson`.
* _Debugger_. (GP-5271) Added `TraceBreakpoint.isAlive(long snap)`.  Deprecated `TraceBreakpoint.getLifespan()`.  Added `TraceObject.isAlive(long snap)`.
* _Debugger:Listing_. (GP-5266) Renamed `DebuggerCoordinates.equalsIgnoreRecorderAndView` to `equalsIgnoreTargetAndView`.  Added `DebuggerCoordinates.differsOnlyByPatch`.  Added `TraceSchedule.differsOnlyByPatch`.  Added `Sequence.differsOnlyByPatch`.
* _Debugger:Memory_. (GP-5164) Renamed `DebuggerAddRegionDialog#setName` to `setPath`.

* _BSim_. Added BSim database `connect`/`disconnect` actions to BSim Server Manager. This will allow an idle connection to be disconnected without the need to exit Ghidra or removing a server entry, which, in the case of a local H2 database, will allow another process to use it. (GP-4867, Issue #6703)
* _Byte Viewer_. Extended HexInteger to other integral data types. (GP-4709, Issue #6658, #6659)
* _CodeCompare_. Added ability to add functions to the last function comparison window. (GP-4634)

* _Scripting_. GhidraScripts can now declare an `@runtime` metadata comment to specify which GhidraScriptProvider is required to run them (e.g., `Jython`). This will allow different GhidraScriptProviders that use the same script file extension (e.g., `.py`) to coexist. (GP-4706)
* _Scripting_. Improved `RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript` heuristics for determining class constructors and destructors. (GP-4764)
* _Scripting_. Changed `RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript` virtual function definitions from using the formal signature (i.e., no `this` param) to using `void *this` param. This will improve the Decompiler output while continuing to not force a particular class structure on the generic definition's `this` param. (GP-4812)
* _Scripting_. `RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript` now caches `vfunction` list in order to speed up processing. (GP-4863, Issue #6834)

### Notable API Changes
* _Search_. (GP-4559)
The MemorySearchService has been changed. This had been a very specific service API created to support just one plugin and was not generally useful. The three existing methods have been consolidated into one method. The old service has been marked as deprecated and may be removed in future releases. If, in the unlikely event that anyone is using this service, please contact the Ghidra team to discuss your use case.
* _Data Types_. (GP-4949)
Added API method `Structure.setLength(int length)` which allows the size of a non-packed structure to be set.
* _Debugger:Agents_. (GP-4847)
`LaunchConfigurator.configureLauncher()` is changed such that `arguments` now requires `ValStr<?>` instead of just `?` for its values. This affects both the new Trace-RMI launchers and the deprecated object-model launchers.

Both of these behaviors can be turned off via the __Navigation__ tool options. (GP-3064)
* _GUI_. Added ability for default tool launch (e.g., project file double-click) to reuse existing tool instead of always launching a new tool. This behavior controlled via Project Window __Default Tool Launch Mode__ option. (GP-3080)

* _Analysis_. Fixed deadlock in Arm Analyzer waffling between overriding the return instruction as a return and branch. (GP-3150)
* _Analysis_. Removed duplicate references placed on different operands of instructions. (GP-3214)
* _Analysis_. Fixed issues related to analysis flag and how it affects asking the user to analyze a new program. (GP-3282)
* _Analysis_. By default, pointer-to-pointer analysis is turned off for ARM binaries in the Operand and Data Reference analyzers. This can result in fewer references created, and can be turned back on if your binaries use pointer data in memory instead of offset values from the current PC. (GP-3335)
* _API_. Fixed bug on pinned symbols when changing image base. (GP-3178, Issue #4290)
* _API_. Revised `ApplyFunctionSignatureCmd` to allow use where function should not get renamed when signature applied. (GP-3350)
* _Byte Viewer_. Fixed bug in Byte Viewer where the last byte in a block could not be selected if the field group size was larger than 1. (GP-1593)
* _CParser_. Fixed parsing of Windows `wdm.h` header file with multi-line strings passed as arguments to a macro. (GP-2809, Issue #4690)
* _CParser_. `CParser.parse(String)` method no longer throws an exception, and, when parsing a structure as a string, the return type will be the structure--not the last member of the structure. (GP-3183, Issue #4903)
* _CParser_. Removed `wchar_t` as a keyword when parsing header files. `wchar_t` will always use the built-in `wchar_t` datatype even if defined with a `typedef` within a header file. (GP-3215, Issue #5108)
* _CParser_. Fixed issue with CParser creating `#define` enum values if unsigned long is specified with parentheses around the value; for example, `#define X (4ul)`. (GP-3216, Issue #5069)
* _CParser_. Pressing __Cancel__ during parsing of header files is now more responsive. (GP-3284, Issue #5181)
* _CParser_. Enum constants are now created by the CParser when `#define` expressions ending in `ULL`, `LLU`, `LL`, and `LU` are found in parentheses. (GP-3285, Issue #5161)
* _CParser_. Fixed expansion of `#define` statements embedded in `#include` files and parsing of constants with `UL`/`LL` size specifications. (GP-3310, Issue #5207)
* _CParser_. Fixed CParser issues with forward-declared Enums and typedefs used within the body of functions. (GP-3371, Issue #3526, #5271)
* _CParser_. `Enum` sizes are now set to the size of an `int` for the processor (formerly 4), and `enum`s from `#define`s are set to the the smallest `enum` size that will fit the number (formerly 8). Future change will add packed `enum` sizes. (GP-3385)
* _Data_. Corrected handling of zero-length components in the form of Listing DataComponent CodeUnits. These were incorrectly reporting a length of 0 instead 1; all Listing Data, including DataComponents, must report a positive non-zero length. (GP-3314)
* _Data Types_. Automatically created class structures now respect the __Preferred Root Namespace Category__ property. (GP-1123, Issue #3196)
* _Data Types_. Added support for floating-point data types to parse decimal string representation. A significant refactor of FloatFormat and BigFloat was completed. BigFloat is now used as the value class for all float data types. Introduced `DataType.getAlignedLength()` method which was needed to differentiate between the _raw_ encoding size and the _aligned_ (i.e., padded) size used by a compiler when allocating storage (i.e., `sizeof`). Example: for x86-32 gcc, 80-bit float has an aligned-length of 12-bytes which reflects compiler's `sizeof(long double)`. (GP-1379)
* _Data Types_. Corrected 80-bit floating point support to include decode, encode, and computation via the FloatFormat and BigFloat support classes. (GP-3022, Issue #4853)

Removed 4 unnecessary classes in emulator: `RequireHasKnownTraceCachedWriteBytesPcodeExecutorState`, `RequireHasKnownTraceCachedWriteBytesPcodeExecutorStatePiece`, `RequireIsKnownTraceCachedWriteBytesPcodeExecutorState`, and `RequireIsKnownTraceCachedWriteBytesPcodeExecutorStatePiece`. (GP-3280)

* _Debugger:Mappings_. __Map Identically__ and __Map Manually__ actions will now refuse to overwrite existing mappings. (GP-3086)
* _Debugger:Trace_. Fixed a bug that allowed the user to undo a trace's initial transaction. This would lead to a subsequent `NullPointerException`. (GP-3213)
* _Debugger:Trace_. Fixed issue with __Undo__ not being effective immediately. (GP-3358)
* _Decompiler_. Fixed a Decompiler decoding error that occurred when a pre-comment contained a null character. (GP-3002, Issue #4836)
* _Decompiler_. Line breaks in Decompiler output can no longer disable a comment annotation. (GP-3029)
* _Demangler_. Fixed missing use of `wchar_t`, `wchar16`, and `wchar32` primitives in Demanglers. (GP-3184, Issue #5080)

* _Scripting_. For stripped GCC binaries, improved prototype RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript identification of vtables and simple class data, constructors, and destructors. (GP-1055, Issue #3266)

### Bugs
* _Basic Infrastructure_. Fixed regression that prevented Ghidra from launching on Windows when its path contained spaces. (GP-1113, Issue #3201, #3205)
* _Data Types_. Fixed IllegalArgumentException error message when adding a duplicate enumerate name for EnumDataType. (GP-1173, Issue #3246)
* _Debugger_. Changed diagnostics to write GDB.log to user directory, not installation. Clarified an error message. (GP-1133, Issue #3218)
* _Debugger_. Improved error reporting when failing to start a Debugger GADP agent. (GP-1136, Issue #3175)
* _Debugger_. Added system property to toggle alternative icons/colors for breakpoints. (GP-1139, Issue #3204)
* _Debugger_. Applying a default everything memory map for GDB targets if info proc mappings fails or produces an empty list. (GP-1142, Issue #3071, #3074, #3161, #3169)

* _Decompiler_. The decompiler now shows results when a HighGlobal has no associated symbol reference in the program. (GP-1184)
* _DWARF_. Changed processing to ignore incomplete DWARF parameter lists in Rust binaries. (GP-1121, Issue #3060)
* _Exporter_. The C/C++ Exporter now emits semicolons after function prototypes when using the Create Header File option. (GP-1145, Issue #1644)
* _Framework_. Corrected address comparison for 64-bit signed address spaces (e.g., stack space, constant space) which could produce non-transitive comparison results. (GP-1178, Issue #3302)
* _Graphing_. Corrected graph magnification behavior when using a high resolution mouse wheel. (GP-1181, Issue #3281, #3284)

* _Headless_. Fixed a regression in analyzeHeadless.bat that prevented the headless analyzer from running on Windows in some cases. (GP-1156, Issue #3261)
* _Importer_. The MzLoader now populates the relocation table when relocations are performed. (GP-1160)
* _Importer:ELF_. Corrected dynamic GOT/PLT markup problem for images which do not contain section headers. In cases where image does not define symbols within the PLT, analysis may be relied upon for its disassembly. ELF Importer's goal is to migrate symbols which may be defined within the PLT to the External symbol space. (GP-1110, Issue #3198)
* _Importer:Mach-O_. The Mach-O importer now correctly interprets indirect symbols as references to symbols within another .dylib. (GP-1120)
* _Importer:PE_. Improved ControlFlowGuard markup and creation of functions (GP-1179, Issue #1547, #1565)
* _Processors_. Fixed bug in SuperH4 `fmov.s` pcode. (GP-1152)
* _Processors_. The ARM instruction semantics for the mulitple-single-element forms of the `vld1`/`vst1` vector instructions have been corrected. (GP-1167)
* _Sleigh_. Fixed a string formatting error in the sleigh compiler. (GP-1124, Issue #3168)

# Ghidra 10.0.1 Change History (July 2021)

### New Features
* _Decompiler_. The Decompiler now supports conversion (hex, dec, bin, oct, char) and equate actions directly on constant tokens in the Decompiler window. To the extent possible, these actions also affect matching scalar operands in the listing. (GP-1053, Issue #21)

### Improvements
* _Basic Infrastructure_. Ghidra now gracefully fails to launch when its path contains an exclamation point. (GP-1057, Issue #1817)
* _FileSystems_. Can now handle multi-level Ext4 extent nodes when reading a file. (GP-1070)

### Bugs
* _Build_. No longer building and distributing the Debugger native test binaries. (GP-1080, Issue #3160, #3177)
* _Debugger_. Corrected potential deadlock condition within Debugger which could occur under some circumstances during a breakpoint or while stepping. (GP-1072)
* _Decompiler_. Fixed a bug in the Decompiler causing `Overriding symbol with different type size` exceptions. (GP-1041)
* _Exporter_. PE and ELF exporters no longer error out when processing non-file-backed relocations. (GP-1091)
* _FileSystems_. Corrected problem mounting Ext4 file systems when the container file is larger than the file system. (GP-1067)
* _Importer:ELF_. Corrected ELF relocation error reporting, including error bookmarks, when relocation handler extension is missing. (GP-1097)
* _Jython_. Added `__file__ attribute` support in Jython scripts. (GP-1099, Issue #3181)
* _PDB_. Fixed bug that prevented constructor signatures from being created properly. (GP-1086)
* _PDB_. Fixed bug in PDB CLI processing that could kill analysis for binaries imported with older versions of Ghidra. (GP-1104)
* _Processors_. Added ELF Relocation handler for SuperH processors. Only a few common relocation types have been added. (GP-1090)
* _Scripting_. Fixed a potential NullPointerException that could occur when trying to run a script that doesn't exist. (GP-1074, Issue #2742)
* _Scripting_. Improved graphing of class hierarchy in RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript and the GraphClassesScript to handle duplicate class names, class namespace delimiters, and to make better vertex descriptions. (GP-1095)
* _Scripting_. Fixed a flaw in the RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript that was not using PDB information to create data member names in class data structures. (GP-1101)

# Ghidra 10.0 Change History (June 2021)

### New Features
* _Debugger_. Introduced the Debugger, along with GDB and dbgeng.dll connectors for debugging user-mode applications on Linux and Windows, respectively. The UI includes threads, timeline, modules, memory, registers, watches, etc., for examining and controlling debug targets. See Help -> Contents -> What's New for more details. (GP-986)
* _Exporter_. For programs imported with the PE and ELF loaders, new exporters are available that write back to the original file layout. Any file-backed bytes that were modified by the user in the program database will be reflected in the written file (except on relocations). Writing back a modified Memory Map is not supported. (GP-786, Issue #1501, #1505, #19)
* _Graphing_. Added Graph -> Data  actions to the Code Browser, allowing visualization of specified pointer relationships in a graph. (GP-194)
* _Scripting_. Added prototype RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript and that uses RTTI information to enhance Ghidra's knowledge of class hierarchy, class member function types (constructors, destructors, deleting destructors, clones) and class member data. The script will label and put member functions into correct class namespace and apply new class structures created either using PDB information, if available, or Decompiler pcode information. (GP-339)
* _Scripting_. Added an example script, LocateMemoryAddressForFileOffset, to demonstrate mapping of a location in the original imported file to the program memory address. Useful for cases where the original file offset is known; for example, a YARA rule match. (GP-782)
* _Scripting_. Created a script to allow users to search for image base offsets to the current cursor location in 32-bit and 64-bit programs. (GP-863)

### Improvements
* _Analysis_. Function signatures, including return types and argument data types, are now decoded from CLI Metadata for .NET binaries. (GP-327)
* _Analysis_. Switched #Strings table processing from ASCII to UTF-8 for CIL binaries. (GP-330, Issue #423)
* _Analysis_. Added Constant, Assembly, and AssemblyRef blob processing for CIL binaries. (GP-465)
* _Analysis_. Added the Variadic Function Signature Override analyzer, which identifies functions that take a format string as a parameter and applies the correct signature override at each call site. (GP-516)
* _Analysis_. Added ability to save and easily reuse analysis options in customer-defined configurations. (GP-544, Issue #2182, #312)
* _Analysis_. Ghidra analysis is now aware of more PE/Windows non-returning functions. (GP-733, Issue #2111)
* _Analysis_. `ResolveX86orX64LinuxSyscallsScript` now properly marks non-returning syscalls. (GP-868, Issue #2761)
* _API_. Revised Structure and Union API, and associated editor, to eliminate the use of the terms Unaligned/Aligned in favor of a packing enablement designation. Also corrected various change notification issues which may improve archive synchronization and merge behavior. (GP-862, Issue #2681)
* _API_. Renamed `Datatype.isDynamicallySized()` to `DataType.hasLanguageDependantLength()` to avoid confusion. This method is used internally to differentiate between fixed-length types and those whose length is determined by the compiler specification's data organization (e.g., pointers). (GP-932)
* _Basic Infrastructure_. Improved error reporting when trying to launch Ghidra from the git repo without Eclipse having compiled it. (GP-815, Issue #2872)
* _Build_. Command `gradle -I gradle/support/fetchDependencies.gradle init` now downloads the Function ID datasets from the ghidra-data GitHub repository so they will be automatically included in development mode and custom builds. (GP-678, Issue #1007)
* _Build_. Performing a `gradle clean` no longer deletes downloaded dependencies. The top-level flatRepo directory has been replaced with the dependencies directory. (GP-811, Issue #1663)
* _Build_. Ghidra now requires Gradle 6.0 or later to build. Gradle 7.x is now supported. (GP-849, Issue #2949)
* _Build_. Made changes to gradle code to remove warnings. (GP-993, Issue #3039)
* _Data Types_. Added support for hexadecimal byte offset display within composite bitfield view. (GP-910, Issue #2959)
* _Decompiler_. Decompiler analysis now automatically identifies and displays loop variables using standard for-loop syntax. When a loop variable is discovered, a condition, iteration, and optional initializer statement are displayed at the top of the loop. (GP-565)
* _Decompiler_. Added the Max Instructions per Function Decompiler tool option, specifying the maximum number of instructions the Decompiler will decode in a single function before throwing an exception. Previously, this had been a hard-coded limit. (GP-767, Issue #2557)
* _Decompiler_. The Decompiler now propagates datatypes across signed comparison operations, so constant integer and enum values display correctly. (GP-802, Issue #2565)
* _Demangler_. Updated the GNU Demangler Analyzer options to provide a list of available formats from which to choose. (GP-94, Issue #2214)
* _Demangler_. Updated the GNU Demangler's Namespace-building to improve analysis performance. (GP-706, Issue #2509)
* _Demangler_. Improved Demangler error checking and reporting to give underlying cause of failure. (GP-850)
* _Documentation_. Added basic instructions on how to install, build, and develop Ghidra to README.md. (GP-847)
* _DWARF_. Improved speed and memory usage when importing large DWARF binaries. (GP-419)
* _DWARF_. Added M68000/SVR4 DWARF register mappings. (GP-556, Issue #1610)
* _DWARF_. Improved handling of zero-length structure components during DWARF processing. (GP-851, Issue #2191)
* _Exporter_. Made various improvements and bug fixes and to the IDA Pro exporter. (GP-831, Issue #1897, #2788, #2882, #2891)
* _FileSystems_. Added support for recognizing unencrypted DMG files. (GP-845)
* _Framework_. Added support for program-specific extensions to a compiler specification. Users can now define their own calling conventions and call-fixups to integrate into decompilation and other analysis (see help for Specification Extensions). (GP-653)
* _Graphing_. Added capability to collapse and expand nodes in the default graph display. (GP-371)
* _Graphing_. Upgraded jungrapht to version 1.1. (GP-377)
* _Graphing_. Refactored graph exporters into a more extensible framework. (GP-440)
* _Graphing_. Graph layout algorithms can now be chosen programmatically. (GP-551)
* _Graphing_. Created additional modified versions of the MinCross layout algorithms, all named to start with Vertical Hierarchical Min-Cross, so that they accept a favoredEdge predicate. When an edge is favored, a pass though the graph layers attempts to align those edges vertically. (GP-625)
* _Graphing_. Added an option to change the background color of the Function Graph window. (GP-760, Issue #1324)
* _Graphing_. Updated Function Graph edge routing when applying the Use Condensed Layout option to reduce edges being clipped by vertices. (GP-768)
* _Graphing_. Added option to disable the lightening of edges in the Function Graph. (GP-769, Issue #1106)
* _Graphing_. Added a distinct visual edge highlight beyond just a different color for graph edge selection. (GP-793, Issue #2953)
* _Graphing_. Added Display as Graph action to the Data Type Manager, allowing visualization of embedded and referenced types of the selected types. (GP-808)
* _Graphing_. Fixed function graph bug that prevented the satellite view from showing the primary view lens. Fixed a layout bug that allowed some vertices to get clipped when condensing the graph. (GP-940)
* _Graphing_. Added graph API method to set descriptions (tooltips) on vertices and edges. (GP-949)
* _Graphing_. Added Vertex and Edge attributes to GraphML export format. (GP-957, Issue #2958)
* _GUI_. Added new Copy Special actions: Python Byte String, Python List, and C Array. (GP-210, Issue #744)
* _GUI_. Updated the Listing to allow structure members to display Plate Comments. (GP-421, Issue #2091)
* _GUI_. Copy/Pasting and Dragging data types now uses a progress monitor. (GP-422, Issue #2379)
* _GUI_. Added right-click menu Data -> Save Image action to allow user to export embedded graphic resource images. (GP-426)
* _GUI_. Changed Symbol Comment Annotation to use the existing symbol when available. This allows for the direct navigation of that symbol's address instead of using the search feature of the Go To Service. (GP-675)
* _GUI_. Added the Shift-F10 keybinding to allow users to show the popup context menu over the currently focused item. The Menu Key can also be used on supporting keyboards. (GP-732, Issue #2790)
* _GUI_. Fixed/Improved the behavior of global menu items and toolbar items with respect to which windows they appear in. These actions can now easily be configured to be either 1) only in menu bar and tool bar of the main window, 2) in the menu bar and tool bar of all windows, or 3) only in the windows that have components that generate the type of context that the action consumes. Added methods to the ActionBuilder class to support these three options. Also, updated numerous actions to make sure they appear in the appropriate windows. (GP-759)
* _GUI_. Improved overall UI responsiveness when performing analysis with the Symbol Table open. (GP-788)
* _GUI_. Updated the Function Tags table column so that it may be used in most Ghidra tables. (GP-816, Issue #2873)
* _GUI_. Updated the Defined Strings view to reload less frequently during auto-analysis. (GP-835, Issue #2889)
* _GUI_. Updated function hovering in the Decompiler to find the correct function tooltip when multiple functions exist with the same name. (GP-959, Issue #2604)
* _Importer:ELF_. Added markup to ELF import for `.note.gnu.build-id` and `.gnu_debuglink` sections. (GP-468)
* _Importer:ELF_. Added ELF import support for SHN_MIPS_TEXT and SHN_MIPS_DATA symbol section index values and provided ability for other processor-specific ELF extensions to resolve ELF symbol memory addresses. (GP-664)
* _Importer:ELF_. Changed various ELF relocations to detect and mark unsupported data relocations which refer to the EXTERNAL block. Applied EXTERNAL data relocations, which have a non-zero offset from the external symbol, will still be incorrect but will have an error bookmark to flag the condition. The relocation addend will not be applied in this case to avoid references to a completely irrelevant symbol in the EXTERNAL block. (GP-1029)
* _Importer:Mach-O_. Improved support for Mach-O object files. (GP-700)
* _Importer:PE_. CustomAttrib blobs in CLI/.NET metadata are now decoded. (GP-414)
* _Importer:PE_. Created proper external references for PE Delay Load Imports. (GP-674, Issue #2554, #2623)
* _Importer:PE_. PeLoader can now read and interpret the `.pdata` section of PE files that include exception handling data. (GP-729)
* _Importer:PE_. Added .exports XML files for the mfc71.dll and mfc71u.dll libraries. Having them allows Ghidra to translate ordinal imports from applications compiled against MFC 7.1 (from Visual Studio .NET 2003) to class and function names with parameters. (GP-1010, Issue #3051)
* _Listing_. Improved Listing view performance, especially noticeable on functions with excessively large stack frames. (GP-268, Issue #109, #2351)
* _Listing_. Added a tool option to hide function auto-comments that appear, trailing a function call in the Listing. (GP-752)
* _PDB_. Improved Ghidra's ability to find and pull PDB files from symbol servers and symbol storage locations. (GP-42)
* _Processors_. Simplified PIC24 return instruction semantics. (GP-647)
* _Processors_. Added support for register alias specification within processor spec (*.pspec). Added `WREG` register aliases for PIC24 processor variants. (GP-901, Issue #2956)
* _Processors_. Fixed issue with the `PPAGE` register not being properly restored after `CALL` instructions in the HCS12 processor. (GP-920, Issue #1099)
* _Processors_. Fixed HCS12 `IDX1` addressing with negative immediate values. (GP-937, Issue #3008)
* _Processors_. Fixed V850 multiply-by-immediate calculation that produced an incorrect value when the fifth bit was set. (GP-939, Issue #2970)
* _References_. Improved performance of reference management for special cases when large a number of references from the same address exist (e.g., entry point designation). (GP-696)
* _Scripting_. ExportImageScript now exports all images within a user-selected region to files within a user-selected folder. (GP-231)
* _Scripting_. Improved TableChooserDialog, allowing multiple rows to be processed at once. (GP-676)
* _Scripting_. Updated the TableChooserDialog to allow clients to set the default column sort. (GP-792)
* _Scripting_. Added Python script comment block support. (GP-843, Issue #1484, #2846)
* _Scripting_. Added ApplyClassFunctionSignatureUpdatesScript and ApplyClassFunctionDefinitionUpdatesScript fix-up scripts that can be applied if a user makes changes to a virtual function recovered by the RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript. Both scripts identify differences between Function Signatures in the Listing and Function Definitions in the Data Type Manager, but the first script fixes all changes to match the signature and the second to match the definition. (GP-973, Issue #3081)
* _Sleigh_. Debug info for Sleigh constructors now includes source file names. (GP-233)
* _Sleigh_. The Sleigh compiler now issues a warning if it generates a temporary varnode which might be large enough to overlap another temporary varnode. (GP-520)
* _Sleigh_. While register names should remain case-sensitive within a Sleigh spec during compilation/parse, register names must not duplicate in a case-insensitive manner since the Program API provides a case-insensitive register lookup by name. The Sleigh Compiler now enforces this. (GP-927)

### Bugs
* _Analysis_. Fixed how managed code entry points in .NET binaries with CIL entry points are detected and labeled. (GP-319)
* _Analysis_. Can now process implementation-specific data structures for Microsoft CIL compilers. (GP-461)
* _Analysis_. Corrected processing for pointers, function pointers, custom modifiers, ValueTypes, static methods, MethodRefs, MethodDefs, and PInvokes found in .NET mixed binaries. (GP-656)
* _Analysis_. Improved constant analysis speed when processing large binaries with a large amount of code not in defined functions, such as exception handlers. (GP-746, Issue #2509)
* _Analysis_. When OverlayAddressSpace was refactored and Decompiler made aware of it for Ghidra 9.2, the VarnodeContext was not aware of the overlays. This was fixed and should eliminate the NullPointerException caused when the Symbolic Propagator calls the Varnode constructor. (GP-751, Issue #2785, #2787)
* _Assembler_. Fixed assembler issue with delay-slotted instructions. (GP-587)
* _Assembler_. Fixed assemble Patch Instruction action to work on listings other than the primary static listing. (GP-623)

* _Build_. Fixed a bug that prevented Ghidra from launching in Single Jar Mode when its path contained a space. (GP-1039)
* _C Parsing_. The C-Parser bitfield parsing has been relaxed to allow declared bitfield sizes to exceed the base datatype size. The effective bitfield size may be clamped based upon the current data organization while preserving the declared size. (GP-558)
* _Data Types_. Fixed a NullPointerException that occurred when trying to edit a function datatype in a datatype archive when there was no open program in the tool. (GP-356, Issue #2407)
* _Data Types_. Corrected the retention of datatype archive search paths, which did not properly remember disabled paths. (GP-639)
* _Data Types_. Fixed potential deadlock encountered when working with the DataTypes tree. (GP-774, Issue #2832)
* _Decompiler_. Fixed endianness issue for joined, two-register returns of `longlong` values for MIPS 32-bit little endian variants. (GP-513)
* _Decompiler_. The Decompiler no longer emits comments in the middle of conditional expressions. (GP-621, Issue #1670)

* _DWARF_. Fixed and consolidated DEX and DWARF implementations of LEB128. (GP-444, Issue #2512)
* _DWARF_. Fixed unnecessary ELF header parsing when DWARF analyzer checks if it needs to run. Improved DWARF analyzer's run-once logic. (GP-695)
* _DWARF_. Fixed issue with DWARF data type importing that could omit the definition of a structure. (GP-929)
* _Eclipse Integration_. Fixed a GhidraDev bug that prevented Ghidra projects from recognizing extensions installed in the user's ~/.ghidra/.ghidra_<version>/Extensions directory. (GP-873)
* _Extensions_. Changed classpath configuration to not contain paths of removed extension libraries. (GP-522, Issue #2637)

* _Graphing_. Fixed bug that caused all address in a function graph node to be colored when only the entry point address had a color applied. (GP-757, Issue #1080)
* _Graphing_. Fixed bug in graph dominance algorithm that could cause the Select -> Scoped Flow actions to go into an infinite loop. (GP-776, Issue #2836)
* _GUI_. Fixed UI lock-up issue related to the Function Tags table. (GP-266, Issue #2366)
* _GUI_. Fixed missing spaces in Front End multi-line log messages. (GP-463, Issue #2534)
* _GUI_. Fixed the following modal dialog issues: z-order changing when showing a modal dialog over a detached window; focusing the incorrect window after showing a modal dialog; script progress dialog not getting placed behind input dialog; script dialogs appearing over different windows. (GP-628, Issue #2398, #2480)
* _GUI_. Fixed NullPointerException encountered when creating a new category in the Data Types tree while the tree is filtered. (GP-745, Issue #2799)
* _GUI_. Fixed Right Alt key that did not work for Ghidra actions on some Windows systems. (GP-747, Issue #2008)
* _GUI_. Fixed Function Graph bug that caused some vertex text to get clipped when using wide address format width. (GP-755, Issue #1008)
* _GUI_. Fixed bug in the Listing scroll bar that caused some screen reader software to deadlock. (GP-772, Issue #2820)
* _GUI_. Fixed bug that caused the UI to freeze when clicking in the Program Tree UI. The bug manifested depending upon the contents of the system clipboard. (GP-775)

* _GUI_. Fixed exception triggered when the Bookmarks table failed to remove a deleted symbol. (GP-989, Issue #3066)
* _GUI_. Fixed exception encountered when double-clicking a structure in an archive in the `closed for edit` state. (GP-998)
* _GUI_. Fixed Function Graph stack trace encountered when changing the graph's background color option after showing and then closing the graph. (GP-1013, Issue #3058)
* _Importer:ELF_. Added support for additional PIC30 ELF relocations (4, 5, 6) and improved register symbol resolution and markup. (GP-710, Issue #2792)
* _Importer:ELF_. Changed processing of ELF absolute symbols (section ID 0xfff1) to treat them as constants by defining equates instead of memory symbols. (GP-902)
* _Importer:ELF_. Corrected EXTERNAL symbol alignment for PIC24, PIC30, PIC33 during ELF import. The improperly aligned symbol addresses would cause incorrect external symbol references to appear on instructions (e.g., `RCALL`). (GP-906)
* _Importer:PE_. Fixed error when importing a PE file with an uninitialized `.textbss` section. (GP-397, Issue #2496)

* _Jython_. Fixed pasting multi-line strings into the Python interpreter panel. (GP-487, Issue #2456)
* _Listing_. A default thunk function now reflects the namespace of the thunked function similar to the way it reflects its name. This change also allows thunk functions of a `this_call` to have the correct `this` pointer parameter. Symbol table queries based upon name and/or namespace will always exclude default thunk functions. (GP-17)
* _Listing_. Fixed #US table processing to correctly interpret the string as UTF-16LE for CIL binaries. (GP-318)
* _Listing_. Fixed a sporadic listing operand hover stacktrace bug. (GP-987)
* _PDB_. Escaped more character strings in MSDIA pdb.exe XML output. (GP-578, Issue #1690)
* _Processors_. Fixed various issues pertaining to x86 instruction prefixes. (GP-220, Issue #2286, #2297)
* _Processors_. Refactored PPC interrupt returns to include return pcode statement. (GP-703)

* _Decompiler_. Extended the Decompiler's support for analyzing class methods. The class data type is propagated through the this pointer even in cases where the full prototype of the method is not known. The methods `isThisPointer()` and `isHiddenReturn()` are now populated in HighSymbol objects and are accessible in Ghidra scripts. (GP-239, Issue #2151)

* _Demangler_. The Demangler now more carefully applies information if generic changes have been made. Previously if the function signature had changed in any way from default, the demangler would not attempt to apply any information including the function name. (GP-12)
* _Demangler_. Changed MDMang so cast operator names are complete within the qualified function name, effecting what is available from internal API. (GP-13)
* _Demangler_. Added additional MDMang Extended Types such as `char8_t`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t`. (GP-14)

* _Data Types_. Updated the DataTypeParser to handle data type names containing templates. (GT-3493, Issue #1417)
* _Data Types_. Corrected pointer data type `isEquivalent()` method to properly check the equivalence of the base data type. The old implementation could cause a pointer to be replaced by a conflicting pointer with the same name whose base datatype is not equivalent. This change has a negative performance impact associated with it and can cause additional conflict datatypes due to the rigid datatype relationships. (GT-3557)
* _Data Types_. Improved composite conflict resolution performance and corrected composite merge issues when composite bitfields and/or flexible arrays are present. (GT-3571)
* _Data Types_. Fixed bug in SymbolPathParser naive parse method that caused a less-than-adequate fall-back parse when angle bracket immediately followed the namespace delimiter. (GT-3620)

* _Decompiler_. Fixed handling of 64-bit implementations of alloca_probe in the Decompiler. (GT-3576)
* _Decompiler_. Default Decompiler options now minimize the risk of losing code when renaming or retyping variables. (GT-3577)
* _Decompiler_. The Decompiler no longer inherits a variable name from a subfunction if that variable incorporates additional data-flow unrelated to the subfunction. (GT-3580)

* _Decompiler_. Fixed a bug causing the Decompiler to miss a stack alias if its offset was, itself, stored on the stack. (GP-246)
* _Decompiler_. Fixed a bug causing the Decompiler to lose Equate references to constants passed to functions that were called indirectly. (GP-247)
* _Decompiler_. Addressed various situations where the Decompiler unexpectedly removes active instructions as dead code after renaming or retyping a stack location. If the location was really an array element or structure field, renaming forced the Decompiler to treat the location as a distinct variable. Subsequently, the Decompiler thought that indirect references based before the location could not alias any following stack locations, which could then by considered dead. As of the 9.2 release, the Decompiler's renaming action no longer switches an annotation to `forcing` if it wasn't already. A retyping action, although it is `forcing`, won't trigger alias blocking for atomic data-types (this is configurable). (GP-248, Issue #524, #873)
* _Decompiler_. Fixed decompiler memory issues reported by a community security researcher. (GP-267)
* _Decompiler_. Fix for Decompiler error: `Pcode: XML comms: Missing symref attribute in <high> tag`. (GP-352, Issue #2360)
