    <li><I>GUI</I>. Added new feature where programs can automatically go to a newly discovered start symbol (e.g., "main") after analysis completes. If the user has navigated to another program location before analysis completes, a popup dialog will appear asking if the user would like to go to the new symbol. Both of these behaviors can be turned off via the <span class="gtitle">Navigation</span> tool options. (GP-3064)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Added ability for default tool launch (e.g., project file double-click) to reuse existing tool instead of always launching a new tool.  This behavior controlled via Project Window <span class="gtitle">Default Tool Launch Mode</span> option. (GP-3080)</li>

    <li><I>GUI</I>. Fixed several issues with enums and the GUI for editing them. The API supported both unsigned and signed enums, but the GUI only supported unsigned enums. Also added extra checking so that enums can't support negative values and large unsigned values at the same time. (GP-3255, Issue #3806)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Clicking a sound icon in the Listing will now stop any currently playing sound. (GP-3393, Issue #5278)</li>
    <li><I>Importer</I>. Headless Ghidra and the AutoImporter API now support loading more than one program, such as when importing a program results in additional libraries getting loaded. (GP-2877, Issue #4929)</li>
    <li><I>Importer</I>. The OMF Loader now handles LPUBDEF symbols. (GP-2976, Issue #4854)</li>
    <li><I>Importer</I>. The OMF Loader now handles unsupported/unknown record types more gracefully. (GP-2997, Issue #4856, #4857)</li>
    <li><I>Importer</I>. Improved GZF/GDT import and export to allow unforced upgrade of older files.  This is particularly important when a user has a version-sensitive issue and needs to have the project file triaged. (GP-3034)</li>
    <li><I>Importer</I>. The OMF Loader now handles CEXTDEF symbols. Known functions are now also created by the OMF loader to improve analysis. (GP-3117, Issue #4912)</li>
    <li><I>Importer</I>. Made improvements to the OMF Loader's relocation handler. (GP-3141, Issue #4909)</li>
    <li><I>Importer</I>. Improved support for loading old-style DOS MZ binaries. (GP-3353, Issue #5229)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:ELF</I>. Eliminated the public mutability and writing of ELF Headers whose implementation is not well suited for this in the absence of any ELF Linker support or related processor extension API. (GP-3152)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:Mach-O</I>. Mach-O external libraries are now linked during analysis. (GP-2602)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. The PE Loader has been updated to correctly recognize and mark the program compiler ID for MinGW programs. GNU Demangler has been updated to recognize and run on programs with GCC compiler option. (GP-1851, Issue #2208, #4513, #4514, #4520, #4906, #5155)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. The PE Loader can now load sections that extend beyond the end of the imported file without error. (GP-2826, Issue #4705)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. The PE Loader no longer rebases images to 0x10000 when the preferred image base is very large. (GP-2827, Issue #2361, #4710)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. Improved PE header parsing so binaries with corrupt symbol/string tables do not prevent Ghidra from recognizing them as PE. (GP-2973)</li>
    <li><I>Jython</I>. Improved Python interpreter code-completion behavior. (GP-2759, Issue #4678, #4699)</li>
    <li><I>Languages</I>. Reverted disassembly of x86 two-byte <span class="gcode">xchg ax,ax</span> back to <span class="gcode">nop</span>. (GP-3372)</li>
    <li><I>Listing</I>. Added <span class="gtitle">Simplify Template Names</span> option (on by default) to simplify symbol and datatype names with complex template info as part of their name. This only affects the Listing display and doesn't affect the actual symbol or datatype name. (GP-388)</li>
    <li><I>Listing</I>. Added options for the starting location of a program when it is opened, which will move the location to a specific function or label. See <span class="gtitle">Preferred Symbol Name</span> under the <span class="gtitle">Navigation</span> tool options. (GP-2141, Issue #4267)</li>
    <li><I>Listing</I>. Changed overlapping markers to blend rather than occlude. (GP-2723)</li>
    <li><I>Multi-User</I>. The Ghidra Server's temp directory can now be controlled by setting the <span class="gcode">WRAPPER_TMPDIR</span> variable in <span class="gcode">ghidraSvr(.bat)</span>. (GP-3053, Issue #4925)</li>
    <li><I>Multi-User</I>. Upgraded YAJSW to 13.09. (GP-3119)</li>

    <li><I>Scripting</I>. The <span class="gcode">RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript</span> has been updated to recognize and process Windows PE programs compiled with GCC (i.e., MinGW, Cygwin programs). (GP-1856)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. The <span class="gcode">RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript</span> has a few improvements for GCC-compiled programs. (GP-2679, Issue #4414)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Added the <span class="gcode">RTTI Found</span> RTTI Analyzer option to the program information, which is used to determine whether to rerun the analyzer and also to decide whether to run the RTTI script. (GP-3293)</li>
    <li><I>Sleigh</I>. Improved Sleigh compiler warning and error messages. (GP-2913, Issue #4595)</li>

<blockquote><p><u><B>Bugs</B></u></p>
<ul>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Removed check for instruction falling into a location being considered for a shared return function. (GP-3044)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Added support for stack parameter tracking, PointerTypedef parameters, restrictions of parameter values to known pointer parameters, and a prototype-setting for propagation of pointer parameter types to memory. (GP-3077)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Fixed deadlock in Arm Analyzer waffling between overriding the return instruction as a return and branch. (GP-3150)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Removed duplicate references placed on different operands of instructions. (GP-3214)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Fixed issues related to analysis flag and how it affects asking the user to analyze a new program. (GP-3282)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. By default, pointer-to-pointer analysis is turned off for ARM binaries in the Operand and Data Reference analyzers.  This can result in fewer references created, and can be turned back on if your binaries use pointer data in memory instead of offset values from the current PC. (GP-3335)</li>
    <li><I>API</I>. Fixed bug on pinned symbols when changing image base. (GP-3178, Issue #4290)</li>
    <li><I>API</I>. Revised <span class="gcode">ApplyFunctionSignatureCmd</span> to allow use where function should not get renamed when signature applied. (GP-3350)</li>
    <li><I>Byte Viewer</I>. Fixed bug in Byte Viewer where the last byte in a block could not be selected if the field group size was larger than 1. (GP-1593)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. Fixed parsing of Windows <span class="gcode">wdm.h</span> header file with multi-line strings passed as arguments to a macro. (GP-2809, Issue #4690)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. <span class="gcode">CParser.parse(String)</span> method no longer throws an exception, and, when parsing a structure as a string, the return type will be the structure&mdash;not the last member of the structure. (GP-3183, Issue #4903)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. Removed <span class="gcode">wchar_t</B></span> as a keyword when parsing header files.  <span class="gcode">wchar_t</span> will always use the built-in <span class="gcode">wchar_t</span> datatype even if defined with a <span class="gcode">typedef</span> within a header file. (GP-3215, Issue #5108)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. Fixed issue with CParser creating <span class="gcode">#define</span> enum values if unsigned long is specified with parentheses around the value; for example, <span class="gcode">#define X (4ul)</span>. (GP-3216, Issue #5069)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. Pressing <span class="gtitle">Cancel</span> during parsing of header files is now more responsive. (GP-3284, Issue #5181)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. Enum constants are now created by the CParser when <span class="gcode">#define</span> expressions ending in <span class="gcode">ULL</span>, <span class="gcode">LLU</span>, <span class="gcode">LL</span>, and <span class="gcode">LU</span> are found in parentheses. (GP-3285, Issue #5161)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. Fixed expansion of <span class="gcode">#define</span> statements embedded in <span class="gcode">#include</span> files and parsing of constants with <span class="gcode">UL</span>/<span class="gcode">LL</span> size specifications. (GP-3310, Issue #5207)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. Fixed CParser issues with forward-declared Enums and typedefs used within the body of functions. (GP-3371, Issue #3526, #5271)</li>
    <li><I>CParser</I>. <span class="gcode">Enum</span> sizes are now set to the size of an <span class="gcode">int</span> for the processor (formerly 4), and <span class="gcode">enum</span>s from <span class="gcode">#define</span>s are set to the the smallest <span class="gcode">enum</span> size that will fit the number (formerly 8).  Future change will add packed <span class="gcode">enum</span> sizes. (GP-3385)</li>
    <li><I>Data</I>. Corrected handling of zero-length components in the form of Listing DataComponent CodeUnits.  These were incorrectly reporting a length of 0 instead 1; all Listing Data, including DataComponents, must report a positive non-zero length. (GP-3314)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Automatically created class structures now respect the <span class="gtitle">Preferred Root Namespace Category</span> property. (GP-1123, Issue #3196)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Added support for floating-point data types to parse decimal string representation.   A significant refactor of FloatFormat and BigFloat was completed.  BigFloat is now used as the value class for all float data types.

    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Fixed a potential NullPointerException that could occur when trying to run a script that doesn't exist. (GP-1074, Issue #2742)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Improved graphing of class hierarchy in RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript and the GraphClassesScript to handle duplicate class names, class namespace delimiters, and to make better vertex descriptions. (GP-1095)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Fixed a flaw in the RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript that was not using PDB information to create data member names in class data structures. (GP-1101)</li>

<H1 align="center">Ghidra 10.0 Change History (June 2021)</H1>
<blockquote><p><u><B>New Features</B></u></p>
<ul>
    <li><I>Debugger</I>. Introduced the Debugger, along with GDB and dbgeng.dll connectors for debugging user-mode applications on Linux and Windows, respectively. The UI includes threads, timeline, modules, memory, registers, watches, etc., for examining and controlling debug targets. See <B>Help -> Contents -> What's New</B> for more details. (GP-986)</li>
    <li><I>Exporter</I>. For programs imported with the PE and ELF loaders, new exporters are available that write back to the original file layout.  Any file-backed bytes that were modified by the user in the program database will be reflected in the written file (except on relocations).  Writing back a modified Memory Map is not supported. (GP-786, Issue #1501, #1505, #19)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added <B>Graph -> Data </B> actions to the Code Browser, allowing visualization of specified pointer relationships in a graph. (GP-194)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Added prototype RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript and that uses RTTI information to enhance Ghidra's knowledge of class hierarchy, class member function types (constructors, destructors, deleting destructors, clones) and class member data. The script will label and put member functions into correct class namespace and apply new class structures created either using PDB information, if available, or Decompiler pcode information. (GP-339)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Added an example script, LocateMemoryAddressForFileOffset, to demonstrate mapping of a location in the original imported file to the program memory address.  Useful for cases where the original file offset is known; for example, a YARA rule match. (GP-782)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Created a script to allow users to search for image base offsets to the current cursor location in 32-bit and 64-bit programs. (GP-863)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><u><B>Improvements</B></u></p>
<ul>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Function signatures, including return types and argument data types, are now decoded from CLI Metadata for .NET binaries. (GP-327)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Switched #Strings table processing from ASCII to UTF-8 for CIL binaries. (GP-330, Issue #423)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Added Constant, Assembly, and AssemblyRef blob processing for CIL binaries. (GP-465)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Added the Variadic Function Signature Override analyzer, which identifies functions that take a format string as a parameter and applies the correct signature override at each call site. (GP-516)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Added ability to save and easily reuse analysis options in customer-defined configurations. (GP-544, Issue #2182, #312)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Ghidra analysis is now aware of more PE/Windows non-returning functions. (GP-733, Issue #2111)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. <code>ResolveX86orX64LinuxSyscallsScript</code> now properly marks non-returning syscalls. (GP-868, Issue #2761)</li>
    <li><I>API</I>. Revised Structure and Union API, and associated editor, to eliminate the use of the terms Unaligned/Aligned in favor of a packing enablement designation.   Also corrected various change notification issues which may improve archive synchronization and merge behavior. (GP-862, Issue #2681)</li>
    <li><I>API</I>. Renamed <code>Datatype.isDynamicallySized()</code> to <code>DataType.hasLanguageDependantLength()</code> to avoid confusion.  This method is used internally to differentiate between fixed-length types and those whose length is determined by the compiler specification's data organization (e.g., pointers). (GP-932)</li>
    <li><I>Basic Infrastructure</I>. Improved error reporting when trying to launch Ghidra from the git repo without Eclipse having compiled it. (GP-815, Issue #2872)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Command <code><B>gradle -I gradle/support/fetchDependencies.gradle init</B></code> now downloads the Function ID datasets from the ghidra-data GitHub repository so they will be automatically included in development mode and custom builds. (GP-678, Issue #1007)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Performing a <code><B>gradle clean</B></code> no longer deletes downloaded dependencies.  The top-level <B>flatRepo</B> directory has been replaced with the <B>dependencies</B> directory. (GP-811, Issue #1663)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Ghidra now requires Gradle 6.0 or later to build.  Gradle 7.x is now supported. (GP-849, Issue #2949)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Made changes to gradle code to remove warnings. (GP-993, Issue #3039)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Added support for hexadecimal byte offset display within composite bitfield view. (GP-910, Issue #2959)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Decompiler analysis now automatically identifies and displays loop variables using standard for-loop syntax.  When a loop variable is discovered, a condition, iteration, and optional initializer statement are displayed at the top of the loop. (GP-565)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Added the <B>Max Instructions per Function</B> Decompiler tool option, specifying the maximum number of instructions the Decompiler will decode in a single function before throwing an exception. Previously, this had been a hard-coded limit. (GP-767, Issue #2557)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. The Decompiler now propagates datatypes across signed comparison operations, so constant integer and enum values display correctly. (GP-802, Issue #2565)</li>
    <li><I>Demangler</I>. Updated the GNU Demangler Analyzer options to provide a list of available formats from which to choose. (GP-94, Issue #2214)</li>
    <li><I>Demangler</I>. Updated the GNU Demangler's Namespace-building to improve analysis performance. (GP-706, Issue #2509)</li>
    <li><I>Demangler</I>. Improved Demangler error checking and reporting to give underlying cause of failure. (GP-850)</li>
    <li><I>Documentation</I>. Added basic instructions on how to install, build, and develop Ghidra to README.md. (GP-847)</li>
    <li><I>DWARF</I>. Improved speed and memory usage when importing large DWARF binaries. (GP-419)</li>
    <li><I>DWARF</I>. Added M68000/SVR4 DWARF register mappings. (GP-556, Issue #1610)</li>
    <li><I>DWARF</I>. Improved handling of zero-length structure components during DWARF processing. (GP-851, Issue #2191)</li>
    <li><I>Exporter</I>. Made various improvements and bug fixes and to the IDA Pro exporter. (GP-831, Issue #1897, #2788, #2882, #2891)</li>
    <li><I>FileSystems</I>. Added support for recognizing unencrypted DMG files. (GP-845)</li>
    <li><I>Framework</I>. Added support for program-specific extensions to a compiler specification.  Users can now define their own calling conventions and call-fixups to integrate into decompilation and other analysis (see help for Specification Extensions). (GP-653)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added capability to collapse and expand nodes in the default graph display. (GP-371)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Upgraded jungrapht to version 1.1. (GP-377)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Refactored graph exporters into a more extensible framework. (GP-440)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Graph layout algorithms can now be chosen programmatically. (GP-551)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Created additional modified versions of the MinCross layout algorithms, all named to start with Vertical Hierarchical Min-Cross, so that they accept a <B>favoredEdge</B> predicate. When an edge is favored, a pass though the graph layers attempts to align those edges vertically. (GP-625)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added an option to change the background color of the Function Graph window. (GP-760, Issue #1324)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Updated Function Graph edge routing when applying the <B>Use Condensed Layout</B> option to reduce edges being clipped by vertices. (GP-768)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added option to disable the lightening of edges in the Function Graph. (GP-769, Issue #1106)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added a distinct visual edge highlight beyond just a different color for graph edge selection. (GP-793, Issue #2953)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added <B>Display as Graph</B> action to the Data Type Manager, allowing visualization of embedded and referenced types of the selected types. (GP-808)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Fixed function graph bug that prevented the satellite view from showing the primary view lens.  Fixed a layout bug that allowed some vertices to get clipped when condensing the graph. (GP-940)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added graph API method to set descriptions (tooltips) on vertices and edges. (GP-949)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added Vertex and Edge attributes to GraphML export format. (GP-957, Issue #2958)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Added new <B>Copy Special</B> actions: <B>Python Byte String</B>, <B>Python List</B>, and <B>C Array</B>. (GP-210, Issue #744)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Updated the Listing to allow structure members to display Plate Comments. (GP-421, Issue #2091)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Copy/Pasting and Dragging data types now uses a progress monitor. (GP-422, Issue #2379)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Added right-click menu <B>Data -> Save Image</B> action to allow user to export embedded graphic resource images. (GP-426)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Changed Symbol Comment Annotation to use the existing symbol when available.  This allows for the direct navigation of that symbol's address instead of using the search feature of the Go To Service. (GP-675)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Added the <B>Shift-F10</B> keybinding to allow users to show the popup context menu over the currently focused item.  The  Menu Key can also be used on supporting keyboards. (GP-732, Issue #2790)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Fixed/Improved the behavior of global menu items and toolbar items with respect to which windows they appear in. These actions can now easily be configured to be either 1) only in menu bar and tool bar of the main window, 2) in the menu bar and tool bar of all windows, or 3) only in the windows that have components that generate the type of context that the action consumes.  Added methods to the ActionBuilder class to support these three options. Also, updated numerous actions to make sure they appear in the appropriate windows. (GP-759)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Improved overall UI responsiveness when performing analysis with the Symbol Table open. (GP-788)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Updated the Function Tags table column so that it may be used in most Ghidra tables. (GP-816, Issue #2873)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Updated the Defined Strings view to reload less frequently during auto-analysis. (GP-835, Issue #2889)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Updated function hovering in the Decompiler to find the correct function tooltip when multiple functions exist with the same name. (GP-959, Issue #2604)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:ELF</I>. Added markup to ELF import for <code>.note.gnu.build-id</code> and <code>.gnu_debuglink</code> sections. (GP-468)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:ELF</I>. Added ELF import support for SHN_MIPS_TEXT and SHN_MIPS_DATA symbol section index values and provided ability for other processor-specific ELF extensions to resolve ELF symbol memory addresses. (GP-664)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:ELF</I>. Changed various ELF relocations to detect and mark unsupported data relocations which refer to the EXTERNAL block.  Applied EXTERNAL data relocations, which have a non-zero offset from the external symbol, will still be incorrect but will have an error bookmark to flag the condition.  The relocation addend will not be applied in this case to avoid references to a completely irrelevant symbol in the EXTERNAL block. (GP-1029)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:Mach-O</I>. Improved support for Mach-O object files. (GP-700)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. CustomAttrib blobs in CLI/.NET metadata are now decoded. (GP-414)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. Created proper external references for PE Delay Load Imports. (GP-674, Issue #2554, #2623)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. PeLoader can now read and interpret the <code>.pdata</code> section of PE files that include exception handling data. (GP-729)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. Added <B>.exports</B> XML files for the <B>mfc71.dll</B> and <B>mfc71u.dll</B> libraries. Having them allows Ghidra to translate ordinal imports from applications compiled against MFC 7.1 (from Visual Studio .NET 2003) to class and function names with parameters. (GP-1010, Issue #3051)</li>
    <li><I>Listing</I>. Improved Listing view performance, especially noticeable on functions with excessively large stack frames. (GP-268, Issue #109, #2351)</li>
    <li><I>Listing</I>. Added a tool option to hide function auto-comments that appear, trailing a function call in the Listing. (GP-752)</li>
    <li><I>PDB</I>. Improved Ghidra's ability to find and pull PDB files from symbol servers and symbol storage locations. (GP-42)</li>
    <li><I>Processors</I>. Simplified PIC24 return instruction semantics. (GP-647)</li>
    <li><I>Processors</I>. Added support for register alias specification within processor spec (*.pspec).  Added <code>WREG</code> register aliases for PIC24 processor variants. (GP-901, Issue #2956)</li>
    <li><I>Processors</I>. Fixed issue with the <code>PPAGE</code> register not being properly restored after <code>CALL</code> instructions in the HCS12 processor. (GP-920, Issue #1099)</li>
    <li><I>Processors</I>. Fixed HCS12 <code>IDX1</code> addressing with negative immediate values. (GP-937, Issue #3008)</li>
    <li><I>Processors</I>. Fixed V850 multiply-by-immediate calculation that produced an incorrect value when the fifth bit was set. (GP-939, Issue #2970)</li>
    <li><I>References</I>. Improved performance of reference management for special cases when large a number of references from the same address exist (e.g., entry point designation). (GP-696)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. ExportImageScript now exports all images within a user-selected region to files within a user-selected folder. (GP-231)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Improved TableChooserDialog, allowing multiple rows to be processed at once. (GP-676)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Updated the TableChooserDialog to allow clients to set the default column sort. (GP-792)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Added Python script comment block support. (GP-843, Issue #1484, #2846)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Added ApplyClassFunctionSignatureUpdatesScript and ApplyClassFunctionDefinitionUpdatesScript fix-up scripts that can be applied if a user makes changes to a virtual function recovered by the RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript.  Both scripts identify differences between Function Signatures in the Listing and Function Definitions in the Data Type Manager, but the first script fixes all changes to match the signature and the second to match the definition. (GP-973, Issue #3081)</li>
    <li><I>Sleigh</I>. Debug info for Sleigh constructors now includes source file names. (GP-233)</li>
    <li><I>Sleigh</I>. The Sleigh compiler now issues a warning if it generates a temporary varnode which might be large enough to overlap another temporary varnode. (GP-520)</li>
    <li><I>Sleigh</I>. While register names should remain case-sensitive within a Sleigh spec during compilation/parse, register names must not duplicate in a case-insensitive manner since the Program API provides a case-insensitive register lookup by name. The Sleigh Compiler now enforces this. (GP-927)</li>

    <li><I>Build</I>. Fixed a bug that prevented Ghidra from launching in <B>Single Jar Mode</B> when its path contained a space. (GP-1039)</li>
    <li><I>C Parsing</I>. The C-Parser bitfield parsing has been relaxed to allow declared bitfield sizes to exceed the base datatype size.  The effective bitfield size may be clamped based upon the current data organization while preserving the declared size. (GP-558)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Fixed a NullPointerException that occurred when trying to edit a function datatype in a datatype archive when there was no open program in the tool. (GP-356, Issue #2407)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Corrected the retention of datatype archive search paths, which did not properly remember disabled paths. (GP-639)</li>

    <li><I>GUI</I>. Fixed Function Graph stack trace encountered when changing the graph's background color option after showing and then closing the graph. (GP-1013, Issue #3058)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:ELF</I>. Added support for additional PIC30 ELF relocations (4, 5, 6) and improved register symbol resolution and markup. (GP-710, Issue #2792)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:ELF</I>. Changed processing of ELF absolute symbols (section ID 0xfff1) to treat them as constants by defining equates instead of memory symbols. (GP-902)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:ELF</I>. Corrected EXTERNAL symbol alignment for PIC24, PIC30, PIC33 during ELF import.  The improperly aligned symbol addresses would cause incorrect external symbol references to appear on instructions (e.g., <code>RCALL</code>). (GP-906)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. Fixed error when importing a PE file with an uninitialized <code>.textbss</code> section. (GP-397, Issue #2496)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. Fixed a bug processing RUNTIME_INFO structures that caused a failure to load PE files under certain conditions when the list is empty. (GP-924, Issue #2995)</li>
    <li><I>Importer:PE</I>. Fixed an issue in the PeLoader that prevented PE files with 0 data directories from being imported. (GP-997, Issue #2858)</li>
    <li><I>Installation</I>. Renamed database <code>db.Record</code> class to <code>db.DBRecord</code> to avoid naming conflict with <code>java.lang.Record</code> class and potential import issues. (GP-193)</li>
    <li><I>Jython</I>. Fixed pasting multi-line strings into the Python interpreter panel. (GP-487, Issue #2456)</li>
    <li><I>Listing</I>. A default thunk function now reflects the <B>namespace</B> of the thunked function similar to the way it reflects its <B>name</B>.  This change also allows thunk functions of a <code>this_call</code> to have the correct <code>this</code> pointer parameter.  Symbol table queries based upon name and/or namespace will always exclude default thunk functions. (GP-17)</li>
    <li><I>Listing</I>. Fixed #US table processing to correctly interpret the string as UTF-16LE for CIL binaries. (GP-318)</li>

    <li><I>Processors</I>. Corrected issues related to retained instruction context during a language upgrade.  In some rare cases this retained context could interfere with the instruction re-disassembly.  This context-clearing mechanism is controlled by a new pspec property: <code>resetContextOnUpgrade</code>. (GT-3531)</li>
    <li><I>Processors</I>. Updated PIC24/PIC30 index file to match latest manual.  Added support for dsPIC33C. (GT-3562)</li>

<blockquote><p><u><B>Bugs</B></u></p>
<ul>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Function start patterns found at 0x0, function signatures applied from the Data Type Manager at 0x0, and DWARF debug symbols applied at 0x0 will no longer cause stack traces.  In addition, DWARF symbols with zero length address range no longer stack trace. (GT-2817, Issue #386, #1560)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Constant propagation will treat an OR with zero (0) as a simple copy. (GT-3548, Issue #1531)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Corrected <B>Create Structure from Selection</B>, which failed to use proper data organization during the construction process.  This could result in improperly sized components such as pointers and primitive types. (GT-3587)</li>    
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Fixed an issue where stored context is initializing the set of registers constantly. (GP-25)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Fixed an RTTI Analyzer regression when analyzing RTTI0 structures with no RTTI4 references to them. (GP-62, Issue #2153)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Fixed an issue where the RTTI analyzer was not filling out RTTI3 structures in some cases. (GP-111)</li>
    <li><I>API</I>. Fixed NullPointerException when attempting to delete all bookmarks from a script. (GT-3405)</li>
    <li><I>API</I>. Updated the Class Searcher so that Extension Points found in the <B>Ghidra/patch</B> directory get loaded. (GT-3547, Issue #1515)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Updated dependency fetch script to use HTTPS when downloading CDT. (GP-69, Issue #2173)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Fixed resource leak in Ghidra jar builder. (GP-342)</li>

    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Updated the DataTypeParser to handle data type names containing templates. (GT-3493, Issue #1417)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Corrected pointer data type <code>isEquivalent()</code> method to properly check the equivalence of the base data type.  The old implementation could cause a pointer to be replaced by a conflicting pointer with the same name whose base datatype is not equivalent.  This change has a negative performance impact associated with it and can cause additional conflict datatypes due to the rigid datatype relationships. (GT-3557)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Improved composite conflict resolution performance and corrected composite merge issues when composite bitfields and/or flexible arrays are present. (GT-3571)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Fixed bug in SymbolPathParser naive parse method that caused a less-than-adequate fall-back parse when angle bracket immediately followed the namespace delimiter. (GT-3620)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Corrected size of <code><B>long</B></code> for AARCH64 per LP64 standard. (GP-175)</li>

    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed bug in the Decompiler that caused <code>Deleting op with descendants</code> exception. (GT-3506)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Decompiler now correctly compensates for integer promotion on shift, division, and remainder operations. (GT-3572)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed handling of 64-bit implementations of alloca_probe in the Decompiler. (GT-3576)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Default Decompiler options now minimize the risk of losing code when renaming or retyping variables. (GT-3577)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. The Decompiler no longer inherits a variable name from a subfunction if that variable incorporates additional data-flow unrelated to the subfunction. (GT-3580)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed the Decompiler <B>Override Signature</B> action to be enabled on the entire C-code statement. (GT-3636, Issue #1589)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed frequent ClassCast and IllegalArgument exceptions when performing <B>Auto Create Structure</B> or <B>Auto Create Class</B> actions in the Decompiler. (GP-119)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed a bug in the Decompiler that caused different variables to be assigned the same name in rare instances. (GP-243, Issue #1995)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed a bug in the Decompiler that caused <code>PTRSUB off of non-pointer type</code> exceptions. (GP-244, Issue #1826)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed a bug in the Decompiler that caused load operations from volatile memory to be removed as dead code. (GP-245, Issue #393, #1832)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed a bug causing the Decompiler to miss a stack alias if its offset was, itself, stored on the stack. (GP-246)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed a bug causing the Decompiler to lose Equate references to constants passed to functions that were called indirectly. (GP-247)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Addressed various situations where the Decompiler unexpectedly removes active instructions as dead code after renaming or retyping a stack location. If the location was really an array element or structure field, renaming forced the Decompiler to treat the location as a distinct variable. Subsequently, the Decompiler thought that indirect references based before the location could not alias any following stack locations, which could then by considered dead. As of the 9.2 release, the Decompiler's renaming action no longer switches an annotation to <code>forcing</code> if it wasn't already. A retyping action, although it is <code>forcing</code>, won't trigger alias blocking for atomic data-types (this is configurable). (GP-248, Issue #524, #873)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed decompiler memory issues reported by a community security researcher. (GP-267)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fix for Decompiler error: <code>Pcode: XML comms: Missing symref attribute in &lt;high&gt; tag</code>. (GP-352, Issue #2360)</li>

    <li><I>Demangler</I>. Updated the GNU Demangler to correctly parse and apply C++ strings using the <code>unnamed type</code> syntax. (GT-3645)</li>
    <li><I>Demangler</I>. Fixed duplicate namespace entry returned from <code>getNamespaceString()</code> on DemangledVariable. (GT-3646, Issue #1729)</li>
    <li><I>Demangler</I>. Fixed a GnuDemangler ClassCastException when parsing a <code>typeinfo</code> string containing <code>operator</code> text. (GP-160, Issue #1870, #2267)</li>
    <li><I>Demangler</I>. Added <B>stdlib.h</B> include to the GNU Demangler to fix a build issue on some systems. (GP-187, Issue #2294)</li>

    <li><I>GUI</I>. Updated the Structure Editor so the <B>Delete</B> action is put into a background task to prevent the UI from locking. (GT-3352)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException when invoking column filter on Key Bindings table. (GT-3445)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Fixed the analysis log dialog to not consume all available screen space. (GT-3610)</li>

    <li><I>GUI</I>. Updated error handling to only show one dialog when a flurry of errors is encountered. (GP-65, Issue #2185)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Fixed an issue where Docking Windows are restored incorrectly if a snapshot is present. (GP-92)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Fixed a File Chooser bug causing a NullPointerException for some users. (GP-171, Issue #1706)</li>
