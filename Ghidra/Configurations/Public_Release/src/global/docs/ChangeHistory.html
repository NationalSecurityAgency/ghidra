<H1 align="center">Ghidra 10.0 BETA Change History (May 2021)</H1>
<blockquote><p><u>New Features</u></p>
<ul>
    <li><I>Debugger</I>. Introduced the Debugger, along with GDB and dbgeng.dll connectors for debugging user-mode applications on Linux and Windows, respectively. The UI includes threads, timeline, modules, memory, registers, watches, etc., for examining and controlling debug targets. See <B>Help -> Contents -> What's New</B> for more details. (GP-986)</li>
    <li><I>Exporter</I>. Added new exporters that write programs imported with the PE and ELF loaders back to their original file layout.  Any file-backed bytes that were modified by the user in the program database will be reflected in the written file (except on relocations).  Writing back a modified Memory Map is not supported. (GP-786, Issue #1501, #1505, #19)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added <B>Graph -> Data </B> actions to the Code Browser, allowing visualization of specified pointer relationships in a graph. (GP-194)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Added prototype RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript and that uses RTTI information to enhance Ghidra's knowledge of class hierarchy, class member function types (constructors, destructors, deleting destructors, clones) and class member data. The script will label and put member functions into correct class namespace and apply new class structures created either using PDB information, if available, or Decompiler pcode information. (GP-339)</li>
    <li><I>Scripting</I>. Created a script to allow users to search for image base offsets to the current cursor location in 32-bit and 64-bit programs. (GP-863)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><u>Improvements</u></p>
<ul>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Function signatures, including return types and argument data types, are now decoded from CLI Metadata for .NET binaries. (GP-327)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Switched #Strings table processing from ASCII to UTF-8 for CIL binaries. (GP-330, Issue #423)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Added Constant, Assembly, and AssemblyRef blob processing for CIL binaries. (GP-465)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Added the Variadic Function Signature Override analyzer, which identifies functions that take a format string as a parameter and applies the correct signature override at each call site. (GP-516)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Added ability to save and easily reuse analysis options in customer-defined configurations. (GP-544, Issue #2182, #312)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. Ghidra analysis is now aware of more PE/Windows non-returning functions. (GP-733, Issue #2111)</li>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>. ResolveX86orX64LinuxSyscallsScript now properly marks non-returning syscalls. (GP-868, Issue #2761)</li>
    <li><I>API</I>. Revised Structure and Union API, and associated editor, to eliminate the use of the terms Unaligned/Aligned in favor of a packing enablement designation.   Also corrected various change notification issues which may improve archive synchronization and merge behavior. (GP-862, Issue #2681)</li>
    <li><I>API</I>. Renamed <code>Datatype.isDynamicallySized()</code> to <code>DataType.hasLanguageDependantLength()</code> to avoid confusion.  This method is used internally to differentiate between fixed-length types and those whose length is determined by the compiler specification's data organization (e.g., pointers). (GP-932)</li>
    <li><I>Basic Infrastructure</I>. Improved error reporting when trying to launch Ghidra from the git repo without Eclipse having compiled it. (GP-815, Issue #2872)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Command <code><B>gradle -I gradle/support/fetchDependencies.gradle init</B></code> now downloads the Function ID datasets from the ghidra-data GitHub repository so they will be automatically included in development mode and custom builds. (GP-678, Issue #1007)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Performing a <code><B>gradle clean</B></code> no longer deletes downloaded dependencies.  The top-level <B>flatRepo</B> directory has been replaced with the <B>dependencies</B> directory. (GP-811, Issue #1663)</li>
    <li><I>Build</I>. Ghidra now requires Gradle 6.0 or later to build.  Gradle 7.x is now supported. (GP-849, Issue #2949)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Added support for hexadecimal byte offset display within composite bitfield view. (GP-910, Issue #2959)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Decompiler analysis now automatically identifies and displays loop variables using standard for-loop syntax.  When a loop variable is discovered, a condition, iteration, and optional initializer statement are displayed at the top of the loop. (GP-565)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Added the <B>Max Instructions per Function</B> Decompiler tool option, specifying the maximum number of instructions the Decompiler will decode in a single function before throwing an exception. Previously this, had been a hard-coded limit. (GP-767, Issue #2557)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. The Decompiler now propagates datatypes across signed comparison operations, so constant integer and enum values display correctly. (GP-802, Issue #2565)</li>
    <li><I>Demangler</I>. Updated the Gnu Demangler Analyzer options to provide a list of available formats from which to choose. (GP-94, Issue #2214)</li>

    <li><I>DWARF</I>. Improved speed and memory usage when importing large DWARF binaries. (GP-419)</li>
    <li><I>DWARF</I>. Added M68000/SVR4 DWARF register mappings. (GP-556, Issue #1610)</li>
    <li><I>DWARF</I>. Improved handling of zero-length structure components during DWARF processing. (GP-851, Issue #2191)</li>
    <li><I>Exporter</I>. Made various improvements and bug fixes and to the IDA Pro exporter. (GP-831, Issue #1897, #2788, #2882, #2891)</li>
    <li><I>FileSystems</I>. Added support for recognizing unencrypted DMG files. (GP-845)</li>
    <li><I>Framework</I>. Added support for program-specific extensions to a compiler specification.  Users can now define their own calling conventions and call-fixups to integrate into decompilation and other analysis (see help for Specification Extensions). (GP-653)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added capability to collapse and expand nodes in the default graph display. (GP-371)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Upgraded jungrapht to version 1.1. (GP-377)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Refactored graph exporters into a more extensible framework. (GP-440)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Graph layout algorithms can now be chosen programmatically. (GP-551)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Created additional modified versions of the MinCross layout algorithms, all named to start with Vertical Hierarchical Min-Cross, so that they accept a <B>favoredEdge</B> predicate. When an edge is favored, a pass though the graph layers attempts to align those edges vertically. (GP-625)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added an option to change the background color of the Function Graph window. (GP-760, Issue #1324)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Updated Function Graph edge routing when applying the <B>Use Condensed Layout</B> option to reduce edges being clipped by vertices. (GP-768)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added option to disable the lightening of edges in the Function Graph. (GP-769, Issue #1106)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added a distinct visual edge highlight beyond just a different color for graph edge selection. (GP-793, Issue #2953)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Added <B>Display as Graph</B> action to the Datatype Manager, allowing visualization of embedded and referenced types of the selected type(s). (GP-808)</li>
    <li><I>Graphing</I>. Fixed function graph bug that prevented the satellite view from showing the primary view lens.  Fixed a layout bug that allowed from some vertices to get clipped when condensing the graph. (GP-940)</li>

    <li><I>GUI</I>. Changed Symbol Comment Annotation to use the existing symbol when available.  This allows for the direct navigation of that symbol's address instead of using the search feature of the Go To Service. (GP-675)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Added the <B>Shift-F10</B> keybinding to allow users to show the popup context menu over the currently focused item.  The  Menu Key can also be used on supporting keyboards. (GP-732, Issue #2790)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Fixed/Improved the behavior of global menu items and toolbar items with respect to which windows they appear in. These actions can now easily be configured to be either 1) only in menu bar and tool bar of the main window, 2) in the menu bar and tool bar of all windows, or 3) only the windows that have components that generate the type of context that the action consumes.  Added methods to the ActionBuilder class to support these three options. Also, updated numerous actions to make sure they appear in the appropriate windows. (GP-759)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Improved overall UI responsiveness when performing analysis with the Symbol Table open. (GP-788)</li>

    <li><I>GUI</I>. Improved mouse wheel scrolling in Listing and Byte Viewers. (GT-3473)</li>
    <li><I>GUI</I>. Ghidra's action context mechanism was changed so that actions that modify the program are not accidentally invoked in the wrong context, thus possibly modifying the program in ways the user did not want or without the user knowing that it happened.  This also fixed an issue where the navigation history drop-down menu did not represent the locations that would be used if the next/previous buttons were pressed. (GT-3485)</li>

<ul>
    <li><I>Analysis</I>.

    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Updated the DataTypeParser to handle data type names containing templates. (GT-3493, Issue #1417)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Corrected pointer data type <code>isEquivalent()</code> method to properly check the equivalence of the base data type.  The old implementation could cause a pointer to be replaced by a conflicting pointer with the same name whose base datatype is not equivalent.  This change has a negative performance impact associated with it and can cause additional conflict datatypes due to the rigid datatype relationships. (GT-3557)</li>
    <li><I>Data Types</I>. Improved composite conflict resolution performance and corrected composite merge issues when composite bitfields and/or flexible arrays are present. (GT-3571)</li>

    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Fixed a bug causing the Decompiler to lose Equate references to constants passed to functions that were called indirectly. (GP-247)</li>
    <li><I>Decompiler</I>. Addressed various situations where the Decompiler unexpectedly removes active instructions as dead code after renaming or retyping a stack location. If the location was really an array element or structure field, renaming forced the Decompiler to treat the location as a distinct variable. Subsequently, the Decompiler thought that indirect references based before the location could not alias any following stack locations, which could then by considered dead. As of the 9.2 release, the Decompiler's renaming action no longer switches an annotation to <code>forcing</code> if it wasn't already. A retyping action, although it is <code>forcing</code>, won't trigger alias blocking for atomic data-types (this is configurable). (GP-248, Issue #524, #873)</li>
