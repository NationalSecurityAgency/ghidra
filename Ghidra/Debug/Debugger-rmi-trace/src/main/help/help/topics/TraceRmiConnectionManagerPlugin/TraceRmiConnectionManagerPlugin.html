    <P>The Connections window manages connections to live debuggers and, at a high level, their
    targets. Each item is a Trace RMI connection (or a step toward one) to a back-end debugger.
    Usually, the back end is a native debugger with a plugin that communicates with Ghidra via
    Trace RMI. These connections are typically established using a launcher script, invoked from
    the <A href=
    "help/topics/TraceRmiLauncherServicePlugin/TraceRmiLauncherServicePlugin.html">Launcher
    Menu</A>, though there are actions here for establishing connections manually or to remote back
    ends. There are different kinds of items displayed in the connection list.</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.thread"> <B>Server:</B> This node displays the current
      state of the Trace RMI server. Ordinarily, the server is not used, since Ghidra can accept
      connections on a one-off basis without starting a persistent server. Nevertheless, often for
      development purposes, it may be convenient to keep a socket open. There is only one server,
      and it is either listening on a port, or not.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.connect.accept"> <B>Acceptor:</B> Each acceptor is ready
      to receive a single connection from a Trace RMI client. The node displays the host/interface
      and port on which it is listening. Once it has received a connection, the acceptor is
      destroyed.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.connect"> <B>Connection:</B> A connection is a complete
      connection to a Trace RMI client. It may have one or more (but usually only one) target trace
      associated with it. The node displays a description given by the client along with the remote
      host and port. Double-clicking the node will expand its targets, if any. If the connection is
      updating any trace, a busy ovelay is displayed on the icon.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.record"> <B>Target:</B> These are children of their
      creating connection. A client can create any number of traces to describe each target it
      wishes to trace, but by convention each client ought to create only one. The target node
      displays the name of the trace and the last snapshot activated by the client. Double-clicking
      the node will activate the target at the last snapshot, and change to <B>Control Target</B>
      <A href="help/topics/DebuggerControlPlugin/DebuggerControlPlugin.html#control_mode">mode</A>.
      If the connection is updating this target's trace, a busy overlay is displayed on the
      icon.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <H3><A name="connect_outbound"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.connect.outbound"> Connect
    Outbound</H3>

    <P>Connect to a back end. The back end plays the role of TCP server while Ghidra plays the TCP
    client. The dialog prompts for the (possibly remote) back end's host and port. Once the
    connection is established, the back end takes the role of Trace RMI client, despite being the
    TCP server. Check the command documentation for your back end's plugin to figure out how to
    have it listen first.</P>

    <DIV class="image">
      <IMG alt="" src="images/ConnectDialog.png">
    </DIV>

    <H3><A name="connect_accept"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.connect.accept"> Connect by
    Accept</H3>

    <P>Accept a single connection from a back end. Ghidra plays the role of TCP server, and the
    back end is the TCP client. The dialog prompts for the host/interface and port on which to
    listen. Check the command documentation for your back end's plugin to figure out how to have it
    connect to a listening Ghidra. Once the connection is established, the listening port is
    closed. The back end plays the role of Trace RMI client.</P>

    <H3><A name="close"></A>Close</H3>

    <P>Right-click a connection or acceptor to access this action. For an acceptor, this will
    cancel it. For an established connection, this will tear it down, rendering its target traces
    dead. Note that the back end may retain its live targets, despite losing its connection to
    Ghidra.</P>

    <H3><A name="close_all"></A>Close All</H3>

    <P>Burn it all to the ground and start over. This closes the server, cancels all acceptors, and
    tears down all connections. Any live trace in the Debugger will be rendered dead, which often
    causes the trace manager to close them. Note that the back ends may retain their live targets,
    despite losting their connections to Ghidra.</P>

    <H3><A name="start_server"></A>Start Server</H3>

    <P>Start a persistent server, able to accept many back-end connections. Ghidra plays the role
    of TCP server, and each back end is a TCP client. The dialog prompts for the host/interface and
    port on which to listen. Check the command documentation for your back end's plugin to figure
    out how to have it connect to a listening Ghidra. The listening port remains open no matter how
    many connections it has accepted. It is still possible to connect by other means while the
    server is active.</P>

    <H3><A name="stop_server"></A>Stop Server</H3>

    <P>Stop the server. This closes the persistent server. This does not affect pending acceptors
    or established connections.</P>
