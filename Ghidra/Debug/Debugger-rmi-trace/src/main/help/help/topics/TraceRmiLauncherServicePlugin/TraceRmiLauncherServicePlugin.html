    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Launchers</H1>

    <P>The Debugger has an updated and simplified launcher system. A nice collection of basic
    launchers for our supported platforms are provided out of the box. For Linux, we provide a
    suite of GDB-based launchers. For macOS, we provide a suite of LLDB-based launchers (though,
    these work on Linux, too). For Windows, we provide a launcher based on the Windows Debugger
    (<TT>dbgeng.dll</TT> and <TT>dbgmodel.dll</TT>).</P>

    <P>Each launcher automates the creation of a Trace RMI <A href=
    "help/topics/TraceRmiConnectionManagerPlugin/TraceRmiConnectionManagerPlugin.html#connect_accept">acceptor</A>,
    executes the back-end shell script in a Terminal, then waits for the resulting target trace. In
    contrast to the previous system, the Terminal is the first and most basic interface presented.
    Even if just about everything else goes wrong, the terminal should still be faithfully
    operational:</P>

    <DIV class="image">
      <IMG alt="" src="images/GdbTerminal.png">
    </DIV>

    <P>The Terminal is fully integrated into Ghidra's UI and so can be docked or undocked just like
    the rest of Ghidra's windows. It provides fairly robust VT-100 emulation. Thus, the user
    experience from the Terminal is nearly identical to using the same debugger outside of Ghidra.
    This terminal-first approach also ensures that you interact with the target application's
    standard I/O. This was not possible in the previous system, as we re-implemented the CLI using
    the back end's <TT>execute</TT> method. The debugger's (and so also the target's) actual I/O
    streams were hidden away within a GDB/MI wrapper.</P>

    <P>Each launcher script sets up a &mdash; usually Python &mdash; environment, launches the
    actual debugger, and provides a sequence of commands for it to load the Trace RMI plugin,
    connect back to Ghidra, launch the actual target process, and start the target trace. At this
    point, the plugin generally takes over, reacting to user and target events, accepting front-end
    requests, and generally keeping Ghidra and the back end synchronized.</P>

    <P><A name="launch_tracermi"></A>The list of launchers can be accessed in either of two places:
    1) In the <B>Debugger &rarr; Configure and Launch ...</B> menu or more conveniently from the
    <B>Launch</B> button in the main toolbar. This is the blue bug <IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger">
    button near the top center. The <B>Configure and Launch ...</B> menu lists all available
    launchers. Selecting one will prompt for its options then launch. To re-launch quickly, use the
    <B>Launch</B> button. Clicking it will re-launch using the most recent launcher and
    configuration for the current program. If this is the first launch of the given program, the
    button will instead activate its drop-down menu. The drop-down is also accessible by clicking
    the down arrow next to the <B>Launch</B> button. The drop-down lists all launchers that have
    been previously configured for the current program. Clicking one will immediately launch the
    program without prompting. The <B>Configure and Launch ...</B> sub-menu of the drop-down
    functions exactly like in the <B>Debugger</B> menu.</P>

    <P>The Terminal provides some fairly standard actions. Other keyboard control sequences,
    notably <B>CTRL-C</B>, are interpreted by the terminal, rather than Ghidra's action system, to
    achieve their expected behavior, e.g., interrupt.</P>

    <H3><A name="copy"></A>Copy</H3>

    <P>This is accessed using the toolbar button or the key sequence <B>CTRL-SHIFT-C</B>. As
    expected, it copies the current selection to the system clipboard.</P>

    <H3><A name="paste"></A>Paste</H3>

    <P>This is accessed using the toolbar button or the key sequence <B>CTRL-SHIFT-V</B>. As
    expected, it pastes the text contents of the system clipboard into the terminal, as if
    typed.</P>

    <H3><A name="find"></A>Find</H3>

    <P>This is accessed using the local drop-down menu or the key sequence <B>CTRL-SHIFT-F</B>. It
    displays a dialog for searching the terminal's scrollback buffer.</P>

    <H3><A name="find_next"></A><A name="find_previous"></A>Find Next/Previous</H3>

    <P>These actions are accessed using the local drop-down menu or the key sequence
    <B>CTRL-SHIFT-H</B> or <B>CTRL-SHIFT-G</B>, respectively. They repeat the last search in the
    forward or backward direction.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_all"></A>Select All</H3>

    <P>This is accessed using the local drop-down menu or the key sequence <B>CTRL-SHIFT-A</B>. It
    selects all text in the terminal, including its scrollback buffer. If all the text is already
    selected, then this selects nothing, so that pressing the keystroke twice is effectively
    "Select None."</P>

    <H3><A name="terminate"></A>Terminate</H3>

    <P>This action is accessed using the local drop-down menu. It will terminate the Terminal's
    current session. Exactly what that means is determined by the Terminal's creator. In general,
    it means to destroy the full debugging session associated with the Terminal. That may cause
    related terminals, e.g., a secondary terminal for target I/O and associated target traces, to
    be terminated as well. <B>NOTE:</B> This action is <EM>not</EM> implied by closing the Terminal
    window. Closing the window with an active session merely hides it. It can be recalled using the
    <B>Window &rarr; Terminals</B> menu. If the session has already been terminated (indicated by
    an orange border) then closing the window will, in fact, destroy the Terminal.</P>

    <H2>Stock GDB Launchers</H2>

    <P>The following launchers based on GDB (GNU Debugger) are included out of the box:</P>

    <H3><A name="gdb"></A>GDB</H3>

    <P>This launcher is a Python plugin for GDB, and so is best suited for debugging Linux
    user-space targets as well as many embedded systems. Please note you may need to obtain a
    properly-configured build of GDB for your target. If you are working with an embedded system,
    it is probably safest to install the "multiarch" build of GDB from your package manager.</P>

    <P>The plain "<TT>gdb</TT>" launch script defaults to launching the current program as a
    user-mode process on the local system. If there is no current program, or if you clear the
    <B>Image</B> option, this launcher will only start <TT>gdb</TT> and get it connected to a
    Ghidra trace. You may then manually start or connect to your target. Note that this may also
    require manual mapping of your program database(s) to the target memory.</P>

    <H4><A name="gdb_setup"></A>Setup</H4>

    <P>You must have GDB installed on the local system, and it must embed the Python 3 interpreter.
    If you have access to PyPI, setting up your Python 3 environment is done using Pip. Please note
    the version specifier for Protobuf.</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
python3 -m pip install psutil protobuf==3.20.3
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>If you are offline, or would like to use our provided packages, we still use Pip, but with a
    more complicated invocation:</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
cd /path/to/ghidra_<EM>
version</EM>/Ghidra/Debug
python3 -m pip install --no-index -f Debugger-rmi-trace/pypkg/dist -f Debugger-agent-gdb/pypkg/dist psutil protobuf
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Beware that GDB may embed a different Python interpreter than your system's default. If you
    are still getting import errors, check the version that GDB embeds:</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
(bash)$ gdb
(gdb) python-interactive
&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.version
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Note the version and ensure that you are invoking Pip with that version. Supposing
    <TT>sys.version</TT> indicates 3.10, you should invoke Pip using <TT>python3.10 -m
    pip</TT>.</P>

    <P><B>Warning</B>: Modern Linux distributions are beginning to adopt PEP 668, which prevents
    installation of Python packages outside of a virtual environment (venv) <EM>even for non-root
    user accounts</EM>. Unfortunately, <TT>gdb</TT> does not seem to honor the currently activated
    venv, and so such configurations are not officially supported. You may be able to work around
    this by modifying the <TT>PYTHONPATH</TT> lines of the launcher script, but your mileage may
    vary. For now, we recommend using the <TT>--break-system-packages</TT> argument with Pip.</P>

    <H4>Options</H4>

    <DIV class="image">
      <IMG alt="" src="images/GdbLauncher.png">
    </DIV>

    <UL>
      <LI><B>Image</B>: This is the path to the target binary image (ELF). Ghidra will try to fill
      this in based on information gathered when the current program was imported. If the file
      exists and is executable on the local machine, it will be filled in automatically. Otherwise,
      it is up to you to locate it. <B>NOTE:</B> If you have patched the current program database,
      these changes are <EM>not</EM> applied to the target. You can either 1) apply the same
      patches to the target once it is running, or 2) export a patched copy of your image and
      direct this launcher to run it.</LI>

      <LI><B>Arguments</B>: These are the command-line arguments to pass into the target process.
      These are passed as is to GDB's "<TT>set args ...</TT>" command.</LI>

      <LI><B><TT>gdb</TT> command</B>: This is the command or path to GDB. We recommend version 13
      or later. We require version 8 or later.</LI>

      <LI><B>Run command</B>: This is the GDB command to actually launch the target. In most cases
      this should be "<TT>starti,</TT>" since this will assure you an initial break and a chance to
      enable your breakpoints.</LI>

      <LI><B>Inferior TTY</B>: Depending on your target and/or personal preference, you may opt to
      separate the debugger's and the target's I/O. If you check this box, the launcher will use
      GDB's "<TT>set inferior-tty ...</TT>" command to direct the target's I/O to a second Terminal
      window.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Once running, you are presented with GDB's command-line interface in Ghidra's Terminal. This
    is the <EM>bona fide</EM> GDB command-line interface, so it has all the functionality you would
    expect. If you command GDB from this shell, the plugin will keep Ghidra in sync. The terminal
    can also be used to interact with the target application when it is running. The plugin
    provides an additional set of commands for managing the connection to Ghidra, as well as
    controlling trace synchronization. These are all in the "<TT>ghidra</TT>" command prefix. You
    can use tab completion to enumerate the available commands and GDB's "<TT>help</TT>" command to
    examine their documentation.</P>

    <H3><A name="gdb_ssh"></A>GDB via SSH</H3>

    <P>This works the same as the GDB launcher, but runs <TT>gdb</TT> on a remote system via
    <TT>ssh</TT>. In contrast to the previous system, which used an SSH library for Java, this
    launcher uses the <TT>ssh</TT> command on the local system. Thus, it should have broader
    compatibility with remote systems, and it should use the same configuration files as you are
    accustomed to. That said, we developed it using OpenSSH, so your experience will be best if
    your copy understands the same command-line arguments.</P>

    <H4>Setup</H4>

    <P>You must install GDB and an SSH server onto the target host. Your local SSH client must
    support remote port forwarding (-R option) and terminal allocation (<TT>-t</TT> option), and
    the remote server must be configured to permit them.</P>

    <P>You will need to manually install the required Python packages on the <EM>target</EM> host,
    comprising our plugin for GDB and its dependencies. Copy all of the Python packages from
    <TT>Ghidra/Debug/Debugger-rmi-trace/pypkg/dist/</TT> and
    <TT>Ghidra/Debug/Debugger-agent-gdb/pypkg/dist/</TT> to the remote system. It is easiest to put
    them all in one directory, e.g., <TT>~/ghidra-pypgk/</TT>. Then install them:</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
python3 -m pip install --no-index -f ~/ghidra-pypkg/ ghidragdb
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Please see <A href="#gdb_setup">GDB Setup</A> for notes about embedded Python interpreter
    versions.</P>

    <H4>Options</H4>

    <UL>
      <LI><B>Image</B>: This is the path to the target binary image (ELF) <EM>on the remote
      system</EM>. Ghidra will try to fill this in based on information gathered when the current
      program was imported; however, it cannot examine the <EM>remote</EM> system. If the file
      exists and is executable on the <EM>local</EM> machine, it will be filled in automatically.
      Whether or not it is filled automatically, please ensure the location is correct with respect
      to the remote system. <B>NOTE:</B> If you have patched the current program database, these
      changes are <EM>not</EM> applied to the target. You can either 1) apply the same patches to
      the target once it is running, or 2) export a patched copy of your image, copy it to the
      target system, and direct this launcher to run it.</LI>

      <LI><B>Arguments</B>: This works the same as in GDB.</LI>

      <LI><B>[User@]Host</B>: This is the host name of the target system, optionally including a
      user name. This is passed as is to <TT>ssh</TT>, which may interpret it according to local
      configuration.</LI>

      <LI><B>Remote Trace RMI Port</B>: An available TCP port on the target system, which will
      listen for GDB's Trace RMI connection and forward it back to Ghidra.</LI>

      <LI><B>Extra <TT>ssh</TT> arguments</B>: These are extra arguments to pass to <TT>ssh</TT>.
      They are inserted immediately after the <TT>ssh</TT> command but before the host name. Beware
      that syntax errors may cause strange behavior, and that not all features may be compatible
      with this launcher.</LI>

      <LI><B><TT>gdb</TT> command</B>: This works the same as in GDB, but with respect to the
      <EM>remote</EM> file system.</LI>

      <LI>Note there is no option to create a second Terminal (TTY) for the target.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H3><A name="gdb_gdbserver_ssh"></A>GDB + <TT>gdbserver</TT> via SSH</H3>

    <P>This works similarly to the GDB via SSH launcher, but instead of tunneling the Trace RMI
    connection, tunnels the RSP (<TT>gdbserver</TT>) connection. There is actually a fairly elegant
    method of doing this straight from within <TT>gdb</TT>, which is exactly what this launcher
    does:</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
target remote | ssh user@host gdbserver - /path/to/image
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>This has some advantages compared to running <TT>gdb</TT> on the remote target:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>GDB may not be available on the remote target.</LI>

      <LI>There is no need to install our plugin for GDB on the target.</LI>
    </OL>

    <P>But, it also has some drawbacks:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI><TT>gdbserver</TT> must be installed on the remote system, and the local <TT>gdb</TT>
      must be compatible with it.</LI>

      <LI>It may be slightly more annoying to map modules from the remote system, because of the
      way GDB reports these modules.</LI>

      <LI>The memory map may be absent. Though this is overcome by creating an entry for the entire
      address space, if the map is of interest to your analysis, it may not be available.</LI>
    </OL>

    <H4>Setup</H4>

    <P>You must have GDB installed on the local system and a compatible version of
    <TT>gdbserver</TT> installed on the target system. You must have an SSH server installed on the
    target system. It may be worth testing your setup manually (outside of Ghidra) to ensure
    everything is configured correctly. On the local system, follow the steps given in <A href=
    "#gdb_setup">GDB Setup</A>. There are no additional Python requirements on the target
    system.</P>

    <H4>Options</H4>

      compatible with this launcher.</LI>

    </UL>

    <H3><A name="gdb_qemu"></A>QEMU + GDB</H3>

    <P>These launchers orchestrate a QEMU user- or system-mode target and connect to it using our
    Python plugin for GDB. Ghidra will inspect the current program and attempt to map its language
    to the appropriate QEMU command, but due to subtle errors and/or outright failure, the default
    value for the <B>QEMU command</B> option often requires careful inspection.</P>

    <P>There are two separate scripts for QEMU, one for user mode and one for system mode. Note
    that QEMU does not support user-mode emulation on Windows, so that script is not available on
    Windows hosts.</P>

    <H4>Setup</H4>

    <P>You must acquire versions of QEMU and GDB that support the target architecture. Aside from
    the copy of QEMU required, setup is the same whether for user or system mode. As for GDB, on
    many distributions of Linux, you can install <TT>gdb-multiarch</TT>. Follow the steps given in
    <A href="#gdb_setup">GDB Setup</A>.</P>

    <H4>Options</H4>

    <UL>
      <LI><B>Image</B>: This is the path to the target binary image (ELF). This works the same as
      in GDB, but is passed to QEMU. This will also provide the name to GDB using its "<TT>file
      ...</TT>" command.</LI>

      <LI><B>Arguments</B> (User-mode only): These are the command-line arguments to pass into the
      target process. These are passed as is on QEMU's command line.</LI>

      <LI><B>QEMU command</B>: The command or path to QEMU.</LI>

      <LI><B>QEMU Port</B>: An available TCP port for QEMU to listen on for GDB.</LI>

      <LI><B>Extra <TT>qemu</TT> arguments</B>: Extra arguments to pass to <TT>qemu</TT> or
      <TT>qemu-system</TT>. These are inserted immediately after the <TT>qemu</TT> command but
      before the target image. Run <TT>qemu<EM>[-system]-arch</EM> --help</TT> to see the options
      supported. Beware that syntax errors may cause strange behavior, and that not all QEMU
      features may be compatible with Ghidra.</LI>

      Terminal window.</LI>

      <LI><B>Pull all section mappings</B>: For some targets the memory mappings cannot be
      correctly conveyed to Ghidra module by module. This setting forces GDB to send the

    </UL>

    <H3><A name="gdb_wine"></A>Wine + GDB</H3>

    <P>This launchers runs <TT>wine</TT> in a <TT>gdb</TT> session on Linux and directs it to a
    target Windows executable. There are other ways to rig a Windows target in GDB on Linux, but
    this is the method we have chosen. This may prevent GDB from processing the object file,
    because it is a PE file, and most copies of GDB for UNIX will support only ELF. Nevertheless,
    Ghidra should recognize the target and map it, giving you symbols and debug info in the front
    end, even if not in the GDB CLI.</P>

    <H4>Setup</H4>

    <P>In addition to the steps given in <A href="#gdb_setup">GDB Setup</A>, you must install Wine
    on your system. Prepare for configuration by locating the actual <TT>wine</TT> executable.
    These are often in some library directory and named "<TT>wine32</TT>" or "<TT>wine64</TT>." To
    find them, either examine the file list of the installed package, or dissect the wrapper
    <TT>wine</TT> script, usually on your path:</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
less $(which wine)
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The locations are usually given in variables at the top of the script, e.g.,
    "<TT>/usr/lib/wine/wine64</TT>". One is for 64-bit Windows targets and another is for 32-bit
    Windows targets. Unlike native Windows, Wine does not (yet) implement WoW64 (Windows on Windows
    64). Instead, the 32-bit target is loaded using a 32-bit copy of Wine, and so is serviced by
    Linux's 32-bit system calls. <FONT color="red"><B>NOTE:</B> Careful attention must be given to
    select the correct <TT>wine</TT> executable for the target program's architecture!</FONT> Even
    though the <TT>wine</TT> executable is smart enough to correct this mistake, it results in
    calls to <TT>exec</TT>, which confuse this launcher. If GDB complains that it cannot place
    breakpoints because of memory access, it is probably because of this mistake.</P>

    <P>The launcher loads some additional support packages in our plugin for GDB, e.g., to scan the
    memory map for PE files and amend the module list. Thus, Ghidra can display both Windows and
    Linux modules, and map them to its program databases accordingly, despite GDB's inability to
    process PE files. There are perhaps other configurations of GDB for Linux that can process ELFs
    as well as PEs loaded by Wine, but they do not seem to be readily available in any popular
    package repositories.</P>

    <H4>Options</H4>

    <UL>
      <LI><B>Image</B>: This is the path to the target binary image (EXE). This works the same as

    This is the <EM>bona fide</EM> LLDB command-line interface, so it has all the functionality you
    would expect. If you command LLDB from this shell, the plugin will keep Ghidra in sync. The
    terminal can be used to interact with the target application when it is running. The plugin
    provides an additional set of commands for managing the connection to Ghidra, as well as
    controlling trace synchronization. These are all in the "<TT>ghidra</TT>" category. You can use

    <H2>Stock Windows Debugger (WinDbg) Launchers</H2>

    <P>The following launchers based on Microsoft's <TT>dbgeng.dll</TT> are included out of the
    box:</P>

    <H3><A name="dbgeng"></A>dbgeng</H3>

    <P>This launcher is actually a Python implementation of a console debugger based on
    <TT>dbgeng.dll</TT>. This DLL represents the Microsoft Windows Debugger engine, and so is best
    suited for debugging Windows user-space targets. Windows kernel targets are not yet supported.
    This DLL also backs WinDbg and several other debuggers on Windows. By default, the launcher
    will search for this DLL in an installation of the Windows Debugging Kits version 10. If it
    does not find it there, it will probably crash with a message in the Terminal.</P>

    <P>Please note on some system configurations, one of the debugger's dependencies
    <TT>dbghelp.dll</TT> may get loaded from the system directory instead of from the WinDbg
    installation, usually because a security product has pre-loaded it into the Python process. You
    might work around this by copying the affected DLLs from your WinDbg installation into your
    Python installation.</P>

    <H4><A name="dbg_setup"></A>Setup</H4>

    <P>Installing WinDbg is highly recommended. If you wish to forego installing WinDbg, you can
    use the DLL provided with Windows, which is substantially less capable, by manually pointing
    this connector to <TT>C:\Windows\system32</TT>. If you do this, some commands, e.g.
    <TT>.server</TT>, will not be available.</P>

      using <TT>dbgmodel.dll</TT>, even when it is available.</LI>

      <LI><B>Path to <TT>dbgeng.dll</TT> directory</B>: By default, the launcher allows the
      underlying <TT>pybag</TT> package to locate the Windows Debugger DLLs. This is typically
      found by examining the registry for a Windows Kits 10 installation. Otherwise, it may check
      its typical installation directory. This will <EM>not</EM> search the Windows system
      directory, but you can configure it manually here. This option allows you to override this

    <P>Once running, you are presented with a command-line interface in Ghidra's Terminal. This CLI

    understands this to mean exit the kd REPL. From the Python 3 REPL, you can access the
    underlying Python-based API <TT>pybag</TT>. This is an uncommon need, but may be useful for
    diagnostics and/or workarounds. To re-enter the kd REPL, enter "<TT>repl()</TT>".

      "Remote", the most common type, indicates two-machine debugging over various

      introspection into the target on which the debugger is running.  "EXDI" is arguably
      the most exotic type - it essentially simulates the normal "Remote" connection using
      the gdb Remote Serial Protocol.  It can be used when connecting to gdbstubs in

    </UL>

	<H4>EXDI</H4>
	
	    <P>Setup for EXDI connections is fairly complicated and difficult to get correct.

	 exdi:CLSID={29f9906e-9dbe-4d4b-b0fb-6acf7fb6d014},Kd=Guess,DataBreaks=Exdi

	      </LI>
	    </UL>
	    <P>The CLSID here should match the CLSID in the <B>exdiConfigData.xml</B> file in the debugger architectural directory.  If windbg has been
	    run using EXDI at some point, there will also be an entry in the System Registry for this CLSID.  The InprocServer32 subentry
	    for this CLSID in the Registry should point to a copy of ExdiGdbSrv.dll, typically the one in the same directory. This DLL
	    must reside somewhere that the debugger has permission to load from, i.e.  not in the WindowsApps directory tree.
	    The <B>exdiConfigData</B> file should be configured for the target you're using. We heavily recommend using <B>displayCommPackets==yes</B>,
	    as many of the tasks take considerable time, and this is the only indicator of progress.
	    </P>

	    <P>The <B>Kd=Guess</B> parameter causes the underlying engine to scan memory for the kernel's base address, which will probably not
	    be provided by the gdbstub. (<B>Kd=NtBaseAddr</B> is also a valid option, as is eliminating the parameter, but, currently, we have no
	    idea how to point the configuration at a correct value. Using this option will cause the load to spin pointlessly.)  If you can,
	    we highly recommend breaking the target near the base address, as the search proceeds down through memory starting at the current
	    program counter.  If the difference between the PC and the base address is large, the loading process will punt before useful 
	    values are detected. If anyone understand how to extend this search (or knows how to set the base address to sidestep the scan),
	    we would really love some guidance.
	    </P>

    <H3><A name="dbgeng_ttd"></A>TTD (Time-Travel Debugging)</H3>

    <P>This is a nascent extension to our launcher for the Windows Debugger. The launcher itself
    functions well, but lacks full integration. It is not yet properly packaged for the Ghidra
    distribution, but is available in development environments. It also needs some additional
    protocol support, namely to integrate its notion of time travel with Ghidra's notion. For the
    time being, we map our time specifications as follows. MS TTD uses a tuple for its time specs,
    both displayed in hexadecimal, e.g., "B5:1A". The first is the "major," which we believe counts
    the events that warrant a snapshot. The second is the "minor," which we believe counts
    instructions executed since the major event. Thus, we would like to map the major to a Ghidra
    trace snapshot and the minor to steps of p-code emulation. For example, the "B5:1A" notation
    would map to "181:26". It should be no surprise the notations are similar, since both MS TTD
    and Ghidra (as well as several other "timeless" debuggers) use a snapshot-replay strategy to
    recover past machine states. However, we have not yet worked out how to have Ghidra cooperate
    with a back end in the replay part of this strategy. Currently, Ghidra will always apply p-code
    emulation, despite having a perfectly good and performant back end available. So, for the time
    being, we multiply the major number by 1000, thus reserving that many Ghidra snapshots between
    major events for MS TTD minor steps. Thus, the notation "B5:1A" will actually map to "181026",
    that is snapshot 181026 with no steps of p-code emulation. This hack will fall short if you
    visit a time where the minor number exceeds 999.</P>

    <P>Furthermore, if you use the Ghidra Debugger UI to visit a past snapshot, the back end is not
    yet informed of your intent. You will probably only see stale records of the machine state.
    Instead, please use the kd commands from the Terminal to navigate through time. The back end
    (MS TTD) will perform the replay, record the snapshot, and command Ghidra to navigate
    there.</P>

    then starts a blank trace. Once running, it presents the Python interpreter, with the
    <TT>ghidratrace</TT> and <TT>ghidratrace.client</TT> packages imported into the local
    namespace. Thus, a developer can explore the API, invoke methods, and observer how Ghidra
    reacts.</P>

    <P>If you have access to PyPI, setting up your Python 3 environment is done using Pip. Please
    note the version specifier for Protobuf.</P>

    <P>If you are offline, or would like to use our provided packages, we still use Pip, but with a
    more complicated invocation:</P>
