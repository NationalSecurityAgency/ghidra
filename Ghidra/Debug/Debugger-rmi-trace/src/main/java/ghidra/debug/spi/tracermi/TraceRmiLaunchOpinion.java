	 * display them.</li>
	 * <li>The menus are meant to display <em>all</em> possibilities installed in Ghidra, even if
	 * some dependencies are missing on the local system. Discovery of the feature is most
	 * important. Knowing a feature exists may motivate a user to obtain the required dependencies
	 * and try it out.</li>
	 * <li>An offer is only promoted to the quick-launch menu upon <em>successful</em> connection.
	 * I.e., the entries there are already validated; they've worked at least once before.</li>

	 * @param plugin the Trace RMI launcher service plugin. <b>NOTE:</b> to get access to the Trace
	 *            RMI (connection) service, use the {@link InternalTraceRmiService}, so that the
	 *            offers can register the connection's resources. See
	 *            {@link TraceRmiHandler#registerTerminals(Collection)}. Terminal registration is
	 *            required for the Disconnect button to completely terminate the back end.
	 * @param program the current program. While this is not <em>always</em> used by the launcher,
	 *            it is implied that the user expects the debugger to do something with the current
	 *            program, even if it's just informing the back-end debugger of the target image.
	 * @return the offers. The order is ignored, since items are displayed alphabetically.
