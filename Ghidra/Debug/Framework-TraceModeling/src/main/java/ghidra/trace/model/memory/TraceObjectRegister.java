/**
 * A register
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are two conventions for presenting registers and their values. Both are highly recommended:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>In the {@link TraceMemoryManager}</b>: If this convention is not implemented by the
 * connector, then the trace database itself will try to convert the object-model tree presentation
 * to it, because the only way to annotate data types and references in registers is to instantiate
 * the appropriate register space. See the manager's documentation for how to set these up.
 * <b>NOTE</b>: The {@link TraceObjectRegisterContainer} for the relevant thread or frame
 * <em>must</em> exist in this convention, even if the tree convention is not presented.</li>
 * <li><b>In the {@link TraceObjectManager}</b>: This convention is required when a register is not
 * known to Ghidra's slaspec, which is certainly the case if the connector falls back to the
 * {@code DATA} processor. It is easiest just to always present the tree. It provides some
 * redundancy in case the memory-manager presentation gets broken, and it allows the user to choose
 * a preferred presentation. In the tree convention, each register is presented with this interface.
 * The name is taken from the object key, the length in bits is given in the attribute
 * {@link #KEY_BITLENGTH}, and the value is given in the attribute
 * {@link TraceObjectInterface#KEY_VALUE}. Some connectors may present registers as primitive
 * children of the container, but that convention is discouraged.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some connectors may present registers in groups. To support this, there is an explicit
 * {@link TraceObjectRegisterContainer}. Ordinarily, the client would use the schema to detect a
 * "container" of {@link TraceObjectRegister}; however, that is not sufficient with groups. The root
 * container (per thread or per frame) is marked as the {@link TraceObjectRegisterContainer}. The
 * connector may then organize the registers into groups, each group being a plain
 * {@link TraceObject}, so long as each {@link TraceObjectRegister} is a successor to the register
 * container.
