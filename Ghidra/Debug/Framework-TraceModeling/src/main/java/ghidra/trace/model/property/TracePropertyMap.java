 * A range map for storing properties in a trace

 * represented by the span of snapshots covered, and space is represented by the range of addresses
 * covered. Currently, no effort is made to optimize coverage for entries having the same value. For
 * operations on entries, see {@link TracePropertyMapOperations}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is the root of a multi-space property map. For memory spaces, clients can
 * generally use the operations inherited on this interface. For register spaces, clients must use
 * {@link #getPropertyMapRegisterSpace(TraceThread, int, boolean)} or similar.
