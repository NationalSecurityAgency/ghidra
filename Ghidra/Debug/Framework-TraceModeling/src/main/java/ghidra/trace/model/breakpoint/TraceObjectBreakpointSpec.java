/**
 * The specification of a breakpoint applied to a target object
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that a single specification could result in several locations, or no locations at all. For
 * example, a breakpoint placed on a function within a module which has not been loaded ("pending"
 * in GDB's nomenclature), will not have any location. On the other hand, a breakpoint expressed by
 * line number in a C++ template or a C macro could resolve to many addresses. The children of this
 * object include the resolved {@link TargetBreakpointLocation}s. If the debugger does not share
 * this same concept, then its breakpoints should implement both the specification and the location;
 * the specification need not have any children.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This object extends {@link TargetTogglable} for a transitional period only. Implementations whose
 * breakpoint specifications can be toggled should declare this interface explicitly. When the
 * specification is user togglable, toggling it should effectively toggle all locations -- whether
 * or not the locations are user togglable.
 * 
 * <p>
 * NOTE: When enumerating trace breakpoints, use the locations, not the specifications.
