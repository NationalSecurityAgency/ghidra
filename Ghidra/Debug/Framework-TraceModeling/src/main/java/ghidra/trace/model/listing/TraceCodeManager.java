/**
 * The manager for trace code units, i.e., the equivalent of {@link Listing}
 *
 * <p>
 * This supports a "fluent" interface, which differs from {@link Listing}. For example, instead of
 * {@link Listing#getInstructionContaining(Address)}, a client would invoke {@link #instructions()}
 * then {@link TraceInstructionsView#getContaining(long, Address)}. Because traces include register
 * spaces, this chain could be preceded by {@link #getCodeSpace(AddressSpace, boolean)} or
 * {@link #getCodeRegisterSpace(TraceThread, int, boolean)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To create an instruction, see
 * {@link TraceInstructionsView#create(Lifespan, Address, TracePlatform, InstructionPrototype, ProcessorContextView, int)}.
 * Since clients do not ordinarily have an {@link InstructionPrototype} in hand, the more common
 * method is to invoke the {@link Disassembler} on {@link Trace#getProgramView()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To create a data unit, see {@link TraceDefinedDataView#create(Lifespan, Address, DataType, int)}.
 * The method chain to create a data unit in memory is {@link #definedData()} then
 * {@code create(...)}. The method chain to create a data unit on a register is
 * {@link #getCodeRegisterSpace(TraceThread, int, boolean)}, then
 * {@link TraceCodeSpace#definedData()}, then
 * {@link TraceDefinedDataView#create(Lifespan, Register, DataType)}.
