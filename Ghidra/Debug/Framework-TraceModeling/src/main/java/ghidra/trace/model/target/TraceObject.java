/**
 * A record of a target object in a debugger
 * 
 * <p>
 * This object supports querying for and obtaining the interfaces which constitute what the object
 * is and define how the client may interact with it. The object may also have children, e.g., a
 * process should likely have threads.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is the focal point of the "debug target model." A debugger may present itself as
 * an arbitrary directory of "target objects." The root object is typically the debugger's session,
 * and one its attributes is a collection for its attached targets. These objects, including the
 * root object, may implement any number of interfaces extending {@link TraceObjectInterface}. These
 * interfaces comprise the type and behavior of the object. An object's children comprise its
 * elements (for collection-like objects) and attributes. Every object in the directory has a path.
 * Each element ("key") in the path identifies an index (if the child is an element) or a name (if
 * the child is an attribute). It is the implementation's responsibility to ensure each object's
 * path correctly identifies that same object in the model directory. The root has the empty path.
 * Every object must have a unique path; thus, every object must have a unique key among its
 * sibling.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The objects are arranged in a directory with links permitted. Links come in the form of
 * object-valued attributes or elements where the path does not match the object value's path. Thus,
 * the overall structure remains a tree, but by resolving links, the model may be treated as a
 * directed graph, likely containing cycles.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The implementation must guarantee that distinct {@link TraceObject}s from the same model do not
 * share the same path. That is, checking for object identity is sufficient to check that two
 * variables refer to the same object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Various conventions govern where the client/user should search to obtain a given interface in the
 * context of some target object. For example, if the user is interacting with a thread, and wishes
 * to access that thread's memory, it needs to follow a given search order to find the appropriate
 * target object(s), if they exist, implementing the desired interface. See
 * {@link TraceObjectSchema#searchForSuitable(TraceObjectSchema, KeyPath)} for details. In summary,
 * the order is:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>The object itself:</b> Test if the context target object supports the desired interface.
 * If it does, take it.</li>
 * <li><b>Aggregate objects:</b> If the object is marked with {@link TraceObjectAggregate}, collect
 * all attributes supporting the desired interface. If there are any, take them. This step is
 * applied recursively if any child attribute is also marked with {@link TraceObjectAggregate}.</li>
 * <li><b>Ancestry:</b> Apply these same steps to the object's (canonical) parent, recursively.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For some situations, exactly one object is required. In that case, take the first obtained by
 * applying the above rules. In other situations, multiple objects may be acceptable. Again, apply
 * the rules until a sufficient collection of objects is obtained. If an object is in conflict with
 * another, take the first encountered. This situation may be appropriate if, e.g., multiple target
 * memories present disjoint regions. There should not be conflicts among sibling. If there are,
 * then either the model or the query is not sound. The order siblings considered should not matter.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This relatively free structure and corresponding conventions allow for debuggers to present a
 * model which closely reflects the structure of its session. For example, the following structure
 * may be presented by a user-space debugger for a desktop operating system:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>"Session" : {@link TraceObject}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"Process 789" : {@link TraceObjectProcess}, {@link TraceObjectAggregate}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"Threads" : {@link TraceObject}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"Thread 1" : {@link TraceObjectThread}, {@link TraceObjectExecutionStateful},
 * {@link TraceObjectAggregate}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"Registers" : {@link TraceObjectRegisterContainer}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"r1" : {@link TraceObjectRegister}</li>
 * <li>...</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <li>...more threads</li>
 * </ul>
 * <li>"Memory" : {@link TraceObjectMemory}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"[0x00400000:0x00401234]" : {@link TraceObjectMemoryRegion}</li>
 * <li>...more regions</li>
 * </ul>
 * <li>"Modules" : {@link TraceObject}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"/usr/bin/echo" : {@link TraceObjectModule}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>".text" : {@link TraceObjectSection}</li>
 * <li>...more sections</li>
 * </ul>
 * <li>...more modules</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <li>"Environment": {@link TraceObjectEnvironment}</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>"Process 321" : {@link TraceObject}</li>
 * <li>...more processes</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface does not provide target-related operations, but only a means of
 * modifying the database. The target connector, if this trace is still "live," should have a handle
 * to this same trace and so can update the records as events occur in the debugger session and keep
 * the target state up to date. Commands for manipulating the target and/or session itself are
 * provided by that connector.
