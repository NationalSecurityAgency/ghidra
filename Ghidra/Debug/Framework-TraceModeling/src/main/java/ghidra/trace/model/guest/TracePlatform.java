/**

 * "host" platform. There may also be zero or more "guest" platforms. The guest platforms' memories
 * and registers must be mapped into the host platform to be used in the trace. This class provides
 * access to the properties of a platform and a mechanisms for translating addresses between this
 * and the host platform. If this is the host platform, the translation methods are the identity
