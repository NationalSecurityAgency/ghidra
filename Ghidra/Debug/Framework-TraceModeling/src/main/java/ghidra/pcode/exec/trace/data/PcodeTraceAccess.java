/**
 * A trace access shim
 * 
 * <p>
 * This encapsulates the source or destination "coordinates" of a trace to simplify access to that
 * trace by p-code operations. This is also meant to encapsulate certain conventions, e.g., writes
 * are effective from the destination snapshot into the indefinite future, and meant to protect
 * p-code executor/emulator states from future re-factorings of the Trace API.
 * 
 * <p>
 * While, technically anything can be behind the shim, the default implementations are backed by a
 * trace. The shim is associated with a chosen platform and snapshot. All methods are with respect
 * to that platform. In particular the addresses must all be in spaces of the platform's language.
 * Note that the platform may be the trace's host platform.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Typically, each component of an emulator and/or its state will accept a corresponding access
 * shim. Thus, each method in the chain of obtaining the shim is invoked during that piece's
 * construction or invoked and passed into the constructor by a factory method. A complete chain
 * starts with {@link DefaultPcodeTraceAccess}. Each method is listed with notes about where it is
 * typically invoked below:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Typically invoked by an overloaded constructor, which then passes it to {@code this(...)}.
 * Clients can also construct the shim and pass it to the shim-accepting constructor manually.
 * Similarly, {@link TracePcodeMachine#writeDown(TracePlatform, long, long)} will construct one and
 * pass it to the overloaded method, which can instead be done by the client.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PcodeTraceAccess access =
 * 	new DefaultPcodeTraceAccess(trace.getPlatformManager().getHostPlatform(), 0, 0);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </li>
 * <li>Typically invoked by a factory method for an emulator's shared executor state
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PcodeTraceMemoryAccess sharedData = access.getDataForSharedState();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </li>
 * <li>Typically invoked by a factory method for an emulator thread's local executor state
 * 
 * <pre>
 * PcodeTraceRegisterAccess localData = access.getDataForLocalState(thread, 0);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </li>
 * <li>Typically invoked by an auxiliary emulator state piece
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * PcodeTracePropertyAccess<String> property = data.getPropertyAccess("MyProperty", String.class);
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * </li>
 * </ul>
