/**
 * This script populates a trace database for demonstrations purposes and opens it in the current
 * tool.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Your current tool had better be the "TraceBrowser"! The demonstration serves two purposes. 1) It
 * puts interesting data into the TraceBrowser and leaves some annotations as an exercise. 2) It
 * demonstrates how a decent portion the Trace API works.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Trace is basically a collection of observations of memory and registers over the lifetime of an
 * application or computer system. In Ghidra, the Trace object also supports many of the same
 * annotations as does Program. In the same way that Program brings knowledge markup to an image of
 * bytes, Trace brings knowledge markup to bytes observed over time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Effectively, if you take the cross-product of Program with time and add Threads, Breakpoints,
 * etc., you get Trace. It's a lot. In order to use all the UI components which take a Program,
 * Trace can present itself as a Program at a particular point in time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each particular component will be introduced as its used in the script below, but for now some
 * core concepts:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>A point in time is called a "tick." These don't necessarily correspond to any real unit of
 * time, though they may. The only requirement is that they are numbered in chronological
 * order.</li>
 * <li>Every annotation has a "lifespan," which is the range of ticks for which the annotation is
 * effective. Some annotations may overlap, others may not. In general, if the corresponding concept
 * in Program permits address overlap, then Trace permits both address and time overlap. If not,
 * then neither is permitted. In essense, Trace defines overlap as the intersection of rectangles,
 * where an annotation's X dimension is it's address range, and its Y dimension is its lifespan.
 * </li>
 * <li>Observations in memory happen at a particular tick and are assumed in effect until another
 * observation changes that. To record the "freshness" of observations, the memory manager tags
 * regions as KNOWN, UNKNOWN, or ERROR. An observation implicitly marks the affected region as
 * KNOWN. The intent is to grey the background for regions where memory is UNKNOWN for the current
 * tick.</li>
 * <li>Observations of registers behave exactly the same as observations for memory, by leveraging
 * Ghidra's "register space." The only difference is that those observations must be recorded with
 * respect to a given thread. Each thread is effectively allocated its own copy of the register
 * space. Most of the API components require you to obtain a special "register space" for a given
 * thread before recording observations of or applying annotations to that thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * After you've run this script, a trace should appear in the UI. Note that there is not yet a way
 * to save a trace in the UI. As an exercise, try adding data units to analyze the threads' stacks.
 * It may take some getting accustomed to, but the rules for laying down units should be very
 * similar to those in a Program. However, the Trace must take the applied units and decide how far
 * into the future they are effective. In general, it defaults to "from here on out." However, two
 * conditions may cause the trace to choose an ending tick: 1) The underlying bytes change sometime
 * in the future, and 2) There is an overlapping code unit sometime in the future.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The trace chooses the latest tick possible preceding any byte change or existing code unit, so
 * that the unit's underlying bytes remain constant for its lifespan, and the unit does not overlap
 * any existing unit. This rule causes some odd behavior for null-terminated strings. I intend to
 * adjust this rule slightly for static data types wrt/ byte changes. For those, the placed unit
 * should be truncated as described above, however, another data unit of the same type can be placed
 * at the change. The same rule is then applied iteratively into the future until an overlapping
 * unit is encountered, or there are no remaining byte changes.
