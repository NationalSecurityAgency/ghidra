/**
 * The memory model of a target object
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface provides methods for reading and writing target memory. It should use addresses
 * produced by the provided address factory. The convention for modeling valid addresses is to have
 * children supporting {@link TargetMemoryRegion}. If no such children exist, then the client should
 * assume no address is valid. Thus, for the client to confidently access any memory, at least one
 * child region must exist. It may present the memory's entire address space in a single region.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TODO: Decide convention: should a single region appear in multiple locations? If it does, does it
 * imply that region's contents are common to all memories possessing it? Or, should contents be
 * distinguished by the memory objects? I'm leaning toward the latter. Duplicate locations for
 * regions may just be an efficiency bit, if used at all. This decision is primarily because, at the
 * moment, read and write belong to the memory interface, not the region.
 * 
 * @deprecated Will be removed in 11.3. Portions may be refactored into trace object database.
