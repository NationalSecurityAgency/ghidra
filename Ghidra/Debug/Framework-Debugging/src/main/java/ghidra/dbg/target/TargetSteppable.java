	 * context prevents its implementation, e.g., debug information is not available for the current
	 * frame. In many cases, with some expense, the client user can synthesize the desired stepping
	 * using information it knows in combination with other step kinds, breakpoints, etc.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The step command completes when the object is running, and not when it has actually completed
	 * the step. If, as is usual, the step completes immediately, then the object will immediately
	 * stop again. If, on the other hand, the single instruction comprises a system call, and the
	 * debugger is limited to user space, then the step may not immediately complete, if ever. A

	 * More nuances may be at play depending on the connected debugger and the target platform. For
	 * example, the debugger may still be reporting some other event, e.g., module load, and may
	 * stop before completing the step. Or, e.g., for GDB on Linux x86_64, a thread interrupted
	 * during a {@code SYSCALL} will have {@code RIP} pointing at the following instruction. When
	 * the {@code SYSCALL} returns, and that step completes, {@code RIP} will still point to that
	 * same instruction. As a general note, we do not intend to "overcome" these nuances. Instead,
	 * we strive to ensure the view presented by this API (and thus by the Ghidra UI) reflects
	 * exactly the view presented by the connected debugger, nuances and all.
