/**
 * Provides information about a given target object
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is mostly a marker interface so that the client knows where to look for information about a
 * target. This may be attached to the entire session, or it may be attached to individual targets
 * in a session. The information is generally encoded as string-valued attributes, for which this
 * interface provides convenient accessors. The form of the strings is not strictly specified. They
 * should generally just take verbatim whatever string the host debugger would use to describe the
 * platform. It is up to the client to interpret the information into an equivalent specification in
 * the UI/database.
 * 
 * @implNote to simplify the automatic choice of mapper when recording a trace, it is required to
 *           update a target's environment attributes before reporting that it has started. Relaxing
 *           this requirement is TODO. Note that targets which do not support
 *           {@link TargetExecutionStateful} are assumed started by virtue of their creation.
 * @deprecated Will be removed in 11.3. Portions may be refactored into trace object database.
