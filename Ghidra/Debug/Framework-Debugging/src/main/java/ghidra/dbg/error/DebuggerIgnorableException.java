/**
 * An exception which should not alert the user
 * 
 * <p>
 * At most, it can be logged, probably without a stack trace. These are sorts of soft warnings,
 * which might be issued when an exception is a normal occurrence. One example is when a model is
 * shutting down. It's common for requests in the queue to be rejected once the model beings
 * shutting down. Exceptions raised by those requests can likely be ignored. Please note, clients
 * will likely need to apply {@link AsyncUtils#unwrapThrowable(Throwable)} in order to determine
 * whether the exception is ignorable. Alternatively, use {@link #isIgnorable(Throwable)}.
 * 
 * @deprecated Will be removed in 11.3. Portions may be refactored into trace object database.
