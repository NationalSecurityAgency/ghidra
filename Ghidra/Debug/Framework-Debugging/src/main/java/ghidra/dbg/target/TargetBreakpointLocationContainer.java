 * A place for breakpoint locations to reside
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is just a marker interface for finding where a target's breakpoints are given. In some
 * models, notably GDB, the locations belong to a global set of specifications. The only way to
 * indicate that a location applies to a target is for it to be a successor of that target, at least
 * by linking. To ease discovery, the breakpoint location container for the target must be a
 * canonical successor of the target. The locations in the container may be canonical or links.
 * 
 * @deprecated Will be removed in 11.3. Portions may be refactored into trace object database.
