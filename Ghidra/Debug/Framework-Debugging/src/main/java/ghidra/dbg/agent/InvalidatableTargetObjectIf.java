/**
 * An interface for {@link TargetObject} implementations which would like notifications of
 * invalidation from parents whose implementations derive from {@link AbstractTargetObject}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is a mechanism used internally by model implementations to manage invalidation of subtrees
 * according to conventions. If every object implementation in the model is based on
 * {@link AbstractTargetObject} (or {@link DefaultTargetObject}), then this is all taken care of.
 * The implementor need only call {@link DefaultTargetObject#setAttributes(Map, String)} or similar,
 * and invalidation is taken care of. To invalidate the entire model, simply call
 * {@link #invalidateSubtree(String)} on the root.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Explicitly implementing this interface becomes necessary when there exists a mixture of objects
 * in the model, some derived from {@link AbstractTargetObject} and some not, including cases where
 * {@link AbstractTargetObject} is obscured by a proxy scheme. A parent based on
 * {@link AbstractTargetObject} will call {@link #invalidateSubtree(String)} on any of its children
 * being removed from the model, including when the parent is invalidated. The implementation should
 * release its resources and also invalidate its children accordingly. For the case of a proxy whose
 * delegate derives from {@link AbstractTargetObject}, the proxy must include this interface, and
 * the call need only be forwarded to the delegate.
 * 
 * @deprecated Will be removed in 11.3. Portions may be refactored into trace object database.
