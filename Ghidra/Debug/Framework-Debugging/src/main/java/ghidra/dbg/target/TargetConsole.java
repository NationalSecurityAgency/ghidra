 * A user-facing console

 * This could be a CLI for the native debugger, or I/O for a target, or anything else the model
 * might like to expose in terminal-like fashion.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is still an experimental concept and has not been implemented in any model. While it seems
 * like an abstract case of {@link TargetInterpreter}, their specifications don't seem to line up.
 * E.g., implementing the CLI as a {@link TargetConsole} requires the server to buffer and parse
 * line input; whereas, implementing the CLI as a {@link TargetInterpreter} requires the client to
 * parse line input.

 * @deprecated Will be removed in 11.3. Portions may be refactored into trace object database.
