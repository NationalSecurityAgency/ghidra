/**
 * The parts factory for creating emulators with taint analysis
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is probably the most straightforward means of implementing a concrete-plus-auxiliary
 * emulator in Ghidra. For our case, the auxiliary piece is the {@link TaintVec}. Ideally, the
 * auxiliary piece implements the analog of a byte array, so that each byte in the concrete piece
 * corresponds to an element in the abstract piece. We've done that here by letting each taint set
 * in the vector be the taint on the corresponding byte. Each part we implement must adhere to that
 * rule. For an overview of the parts of a p-code emulator, see {@link PcodeEmulator}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As recommended by the documentation, we've implemented the factory as a singleton. As presented
 * in the source, we'll visit each component in this order:
 * <ul>
 * <li>P-code Arithmetic: {@link TaintPcodeArithmetic}</li>
 * <li>Userop Library: {@link TaintPcodeUseropLibrary}</li>
 * <li>P-code Executor: {@link TaintPcodeThreadExecutor}</li>
 * <li>Machine State
 * <ul>
 * <li>Stand alone: {@link TaintPcodeExecutorState}</li>
 * <li>Trace integrated: {@link TaintTracePcodeExecutorState}</li>
 * <li>Debugger integrated: {@link TaintTracePcodeExecutorState} (same as Trace integrated)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you're following from the {@link ghidra.taint} package documentation, you'll want to return to
 * {@link ghidra.pcode.emu.taint.plain} before you examine the trace-integrated state. Similarly,
 * you'll want to return to {@link ghidra.pcode.emu.taint.trace} before you examine the
 * Debugger-integrated state.
