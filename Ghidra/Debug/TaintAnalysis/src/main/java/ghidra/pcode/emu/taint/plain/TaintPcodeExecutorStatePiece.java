/**
 * The state piece for holding taint marks in the emulator's machine state
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because this is already a working solution, most of the logic has already been abstracted into a
 * super class {@link AbstractTaintPcodeExecutorStatePiece}. This class serves only to choose the
 * type {@link TaintSpace}, which implements the real storage logic, and provide a map from address
 * space to that type. Note the concept of a space map is introduced by
 * {@link AbstractLongOffsetPcodeExecutorStatePiece}, which is provided by the p-code emulation
 * framework. This is suitable for state pieces with concrete addresses. This likely fits your
 * auxiliary piece, but may not. If you choose to use abstract addresses for your auxiliary piece,
 * then your implementation of state will not follow the archetype presented here. You'll instead
 * want to implement {@link TracePcodeExecutorState} directly, take the concrete piece provided, and
 * wrap it as you see fit. You may still benefit by referring to the implementation of
 * {@link PairedPcodeExecutorState}. When implementing your flavor of
 * {@link PairedPcodeExecutorState#getVar(AddressSpace, Pair, int, boolean, Reason)}, still consider
 * that you could benefit from the concrete element of the offset pair passed in.
