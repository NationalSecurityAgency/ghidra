/**
 * The Taint domain package
 * 
 * <p>
 * This package implements the domain of taint analysis. {@link ghidra.taint.model.TaintVec} models
 * an array of bytes, each having a {@link ghidra.taint.model.TaintSet}. A
 * {@link ghidra.taint.model.TaintSet} is in turn made of several
 * {@link ghidra.taint.model.TaintMark}s. Each mark is a symbol with optional tags. We use the tags
 * as a means of handling indirection, so that we don't have to decide up front whether tainted
 * offsets taint the values read and written from memory. We allow them to be tainted, but add a tag
 * to the mark, so they can be examined and/or filtered by the user.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To facilitate storage and presentation of taint, we will need to implement some
 * (de)serialization. Rather than use Java's notion, we'll just implement toString and a static
 * parse method for sets and marks.
 * 
 * <p>
 * We recommend you read the documentation and source from the bottom up:
 * {@link ghidra.taint.model.TaintMark}, {@link ghidra.taint.model.TaintSet},
 * {@link ghidra.taint.model.TaintVec}.
