Random Notes on the Implementation of Debugger-agent-frida

- Building libfrida-core.so:
	You can download libfrida-core.a for Frida by grabbing the latest frida-core-devkit for your OS from 
		https://github.com/frida/frida/releases 
    or by downloading the Frida source and running:
		python3 devkit.py frida-core linux-x86_64 DEVKIT
	from the "releng" directory. 
	
Ghidra needs a dynamically-loadable version of libfrida-core.a which you can generate by something like:

	cp ghidra_wrapper.c into the directory with libfrida-core.a and frida-core.h (distro or DEVKIT)
	g++ -shared ghidra_wrapper.c ./libfrida-core.a -o libfrida-core.so

Libfrida-core.so should then be added to the jna.library.path or put someplace like /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, where it will get picked up by Native.load().

- Frida Functionality
	The most interesting bits of Frida are available as "methods" from the Objects Tree.  For instance, if you select a function and hit "M", you will get a dialog with available methods.  Selecting, for example, "intercept" will bring up a second dialog with the relevant parameters.  For many of these, you will want to provide your own Javascript "on" functions, e.g. onEnter for the Interceptor. Stalking is available on Threads and the individual thread entries. Scan, protect, and watch functions are available on Memory. You can also redirect the output to GhidraScript, although this relies on a bit of a hack.  If your Javascript "Name" parameter is something like "interpreter", prepend "interpreter<=" to the output from your Javascript, and the results will be passed to both the console and the script.
	
- State in Frida:
	Commands in Frida are, generally speaking, not state-dependent, i.e. they do not depend on whether the target is running or not, only on whether the frida-agent thread is running. Many of the gum-based commands do, however, depend on ptrace.  If you have a ptrace-based debugger attached to the target, they will time out.  You can attach a debugger after Frida, but you will have to detach it to regain the gum-based functionality.  "Detach" in most debuggers includes "resume", so it is difficult to get state other than the "initial" state from the frida-agent injection point.  It would be nice if "disconnect" worked, but "disconnect" (i.e. detach without resuming) also leaves Frida in a partially disabled state.
	
- Errors in Frida
	The cloaking logic in Frida, e.g. in gum_cloak_add_thread and gum_cloak_index_of_thread, is broken as of the writing of this note.  Gum_cloak_add_thread is called for every thread, and gum_cloak_index_of_thread returns a non-negative result for every call but the first.  As a result, every thread but one is cloaked, and enumerateThreads returns only a single thread. This is documented in Issue #625 for the frida-gum project.  A quick fix is to comment out the cloaking call in frida-gum/gum/gumprocess.c::gum_emit_thread_if_not_cloaked.  Obviously, this may have other undesirable effects, but...
	
	The logic in the ordering of exception handlers also appears to be broken (Issue #627). New handlers are appended to the queue, in most cases after gum_exceptor_handle_scope_exception and gum_quick_core_handle_crashed_js. Gum_exceptor_handle_scope_exception almost always returns TRUE, breaking out of the queue and causing any remaining handlers to be ignored. This means any handler added with Process.setExceptionHandler is likely to be ignored.  A quick fix is to modify gum_exceptor_add to use g_slist_prepend instead ot g_slist_append.
	
	Not really an error, but worth noting: building libfrida-core.so from the source may result in a library with glib2.0 dependencies that are incompatible with the current version of Eclipse. The not-so-simple solution is to build Eclipse on the machine that you used to build libfrida-core.
