/**
 * A cache of futures which pairs each to its result by key
 * 
 * <p>
 * The cache accepts promises and results, storing unpaired entries for a timeout period. Each
 * promise is fulfilled when the cache accepts its corresponding result, determined by key.
 * Conversely, a cached result fulfills its corresponding promise, determined by key, when the cache
 * accepts that promise. Thus, the cache is two sided. When both the promise and the result for a
 * given key enter the cache, they are paired, the promise is fulfilled, and both are removed from
 * the cache.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an entry is not paired within the timeout period, it is evicted. An evicted promise is likely
 * a recoverable error, e.g., a request timed out. An evicted result is likely a logic or
 * synchronization error. Requests, i.e., promises, are usually created before the result is
 * obtained. A result may enter the cache first due to variance in execution order, but the promise
 * usually enters soon after. If not, more than likely, the developer forgot to enter the request
 * into the cache, or if the result was reported out of band, it is gratuitous. Callbacks are
 * provided for eviction from either side of the cache.
 * 
 * @param <K> the type of keys
 * @param <V> the type of result values
