It appears ghidragdb is missing from the remote system. This can happen if you
forgot to install the required package. This can also happen if you installed
the packages to a different Python environment than is being used by the
remote's gdb.

This script is about to offer automatic resolution. If you'd like to resolve
this manually, answer no to the next question and then see Ghidra's help by
pressing F1 in the dialog of launch parameters.

WARNING: Answering yes to the next question will invoke pip to try to install
missing or incorrectly-versioned dependencies. It may attempt to find packages
from the PyPI mirror configured on the REMOTE system. If you have not configured
one, it will connect to the official one.

WARNING: We invoke pip with the --break-system-packages flag, because some
debuggers that embed Python (gdb, lldb) may not support virtual environments,
and so the packages must be installed to your user environment.

NOTE: This will copy Python wheels into the HOME directory of the user on the
remote system. You may be prompted to authenticate a few times while packages
are copied and installed.

NOTE: Automatic resolution will cause this session to terminate. When it has
finished, try launching again.
