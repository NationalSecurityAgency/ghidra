	 * @param sessions any terminal sessions created while launching the back-end. If there are more
	 *            than one, they are distinguished by launcher-defined keys. If there are no
	 *            sessions, then there was likely a catastrophic error in the launcher.

	 * @param connection if the target connected back to Ghidra, that connection
	 * @param trace if the connection started a trace, the (first) trace it created
