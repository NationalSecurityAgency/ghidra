/**
 * A recorder from target object, usually a process, to a destination trace
 * 
 * <p>
 * The recorder is the glue from a portion of a debugger's model into a Ghidra trace. As such, this
 * object maintains a mapping between corresponding objects of interest in the model tree to the
 * trace, and that mapping can be queried. In most cases, UI components which deal with tracing need
 * only read the trace in order to populate their display. Several methods are provided for
 * retrieving corresponding objects from the target or trace given that object in the other. These
 * methods may return null for a variety of reasons:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>The particular type may not be supported or of interest to the recorder.</li>
 * <li>The recorder may not have actually recorded the object yet, despite receiving notice.
 * Recording is asynchronous, and it may also be waiting for additional dependencies or attributes
 * before it can create the corresponding trace object.</li>
 * <li>The target object may no longer exist for a given trace object.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The recorder copies information in one direction; thus, if a trace UI component needs to affect
 * the target, it must do so via the debugger's model. Such components should use the
 * {@code getTarget*} methods in order to find the target object for a given trace object. The
 * effects of calls on recorded target objects are recorded into the trace automatically. Thus, it
 * is not necessary for trace UI components to react to the successful completion of such calls, so
 * long as they're listening for changes to the trace. However, they MUST react to the exceptional
 * completion of such calls, most likely displaying an error dialog.
