/**
 * A connection to a TraceRmi back end
 *
 * <p>
 * TraceRmi is a two-way request-reply channel, usually over TCP. The back end, i.e., the trace-rmi
 * plugin hosted in the target platform's actual debugger, is granted a fixed set of
 * methods/messages for creating and populating a {@link Trace}. Each such trace is designated as a
 * target. The back end provides a set of methods for the front-end to use to control the connection
 * and its targets. For a given connection, the methods are fixed, but each back end may provide a
 * different set of methods to best describe/model its command set. The same methods are applicable
 * to all of the back end's target. While uncommon, one back end may create several targets. E.g.,
 * if a target creates a child process, and the back-end debugger is configured to remain attached
 * to both parent and child, then it should create and publish a second target.
