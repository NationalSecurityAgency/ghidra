/**
 * An opinion governing selection of language and compiler spec when recording a target
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a target is recorded, the model service collects offers for the target and its environment
 * by querying all opinions discovered in the classpath. See
 * {@link #queryOpinions(TargetObject, boolean)}. If the recording was triggered automatically, the
 * highest-confidence offer is taken, so long as it is not an "override" offer. If triggered
 * manually, all offers are displayed for the user to choose from.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Override offers have negative confidence, and typically, one is only selected by the user as a
 * last-ditch effort when no opinion exists for the desired target. As such, one is never selected
 * automatically, and they are hidden from the manual record prompt by default.
