    <H1>Debugger Bots: Workflow Automation</H1>

    <P>Bots are a pluggable part of the Debugger's Workflow plugin and provide useful automation,
    taking actions on the user's behalf that would otherwise be tedious, or that should occur
    "under the hood." Each can be toggled from the <SPAN class="menu">Edit &rarr; Tool
    Options</SPAN> menu in Ghidra's <EM>Project</EM> window.</P>

    <H2><A name="show_interpreter"></A>Show Interpreter</H2>

    <P>This bot automatically displays the interpreter console for new debugger connections. If a
    connection does not present an interpreter, then this bot will take no action. This action can
    be performed manually using the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#console">Console</A> action in
    the Commands and Objects window.</P>

    <H2><A name="disassemble_at_pc"></A>Disassemble at Program Counter</H2>

    <P>This bot automatically disassembles trace memory, starting at the program counter. It is
    activated whenever an open trace's memory or program counters change. If the target presents a
    stack, then the bot will prefer to use the program counter recorded in the innermost frame 0.
    Otherwise, it will use the value of the program counter register. To accommodate multi-threaded
    traces, the bot considers all threads when responding to memory changes. It considers only the
    affected thread for program counter changes. This action can be performed manually using the <A
    href="help/topics/DisassemblerPlugin/Disassembly.htm#Disassemble">Disassemble</A> command in
    the Dynamic Listing window.</P>

    <H2><A name="map_modules"></A>Map Modules</H2>

    <P>This bot automatically maps trace modules to programs opened in the same tool. It is
    activated whenever a trace or program is opened, or when an opened trace's modules change. For
    a given trace, this bot considers only those modules not already mapped, seeking suitable
    programs open in the same tool. If the trace is open in multiple tools (not common) the bot
    will consider programs from all such tools where the workflow plugin is enabled. This action
    can be performed manually using the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerModulesPlugin/DebuggerModulesPlugin.html#map_modules">Map Modules</A>
    action in the Modules and Sections window.</P>

    <H2><A name="map_sections"></A>Map Sections</H2>

    <P>This bot automatically maps trace sections to memory blocks of programs opened in the same
    tool. Its operation is analogous to that of the Map Modules Bot, except that it creates the
    mapped ranges by section. It is not commonly used, as it's less efficient than the Map Modules
    Bot, but it is required whenever a target presents sections which can be relocated
    independently of other sections in the same module. This is more common in abstract machines,
    such as the Java Virtual Machine, where each method is a "section." This action can be
    performed manually using the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerModulesPlugin/DebuggerModulesPlugin.html#map_sections">Map Sections</A>
    action in the Modules and Sections window.</P>
