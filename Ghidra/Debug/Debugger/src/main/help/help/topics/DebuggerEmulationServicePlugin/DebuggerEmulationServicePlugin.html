    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Emulation Service</H1>

    <P>This service plugin provides emulation to the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTraceManagerServicePlugin/DebuggerTraceManagerServicePlugin.html">Trace
    Manager</A> and provides actions for launching emulated traces from programs, i.e., without
    requiring a connected debugger. Please note that "pure emulation" of a target program, while it
    doesn't require a platform to execute the target natively, it typically does require
    significant state initialization and dependency stubbing, except in limited circumstances.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <H3><A name="emulate_program"></A> Emulate Program</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever a program is active. It will create a new trace suitable
    for "pure emulation" of the current program starting at the current address. More precisely, it
    will open a new blank trace, initializes it with the current program's memory map, allocates a
    stack, and creates a thread whose program counter is initialized to the current address and
    whose registers are initialized to the register context at the current address. Optionally, any
    other initialization can be done by manually modifying the trace in the UI, or using a script.
    The trace and/or p-code stepping actions can then be used to emulate.</P>

    <H3><A name="add_emulated_thread"></A> Add Emulated Thread</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever a "pure emulation" trace is active. It spawns a new thread
    in the current trace suitable for emulating starting at the current address. More precisely, it
    allocates another stack and creates a new thread whose program counter is initialized to the
    current address and whose registers are initialized to the register context at the current
    address. Optionally, other registers can be initialized via the UI or a script. The new thread
    is activated so that stepping actions will affect it by default.</P>
