    <P>This window displays all recorded snapshots in the current trace. Typically, there is one
    snapshot per event recorded. Other windows often display the times of various events or use
    time ranges to describe lifespans of various objects. Those times refer to the <EM>snap</EM>,
    which is a 0-up counter of snapshot records. Thus, a snapshot is a collection of observations
    of a target's state, usually while suspended, along with any mark up. Double-clicking a
    snapshot <EM>activates</EM> the selected point in time, i.e., the entire Debugger UI will
    navigate to the selected snapshot. <B>NOTE:</B> Navigating through time is not permitted while
    in <B>Control Target</B> <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerControlPlugin/DebuggerControlPlugin.html#control_mode">mode</A>.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Snap - the 0-up index of the snapshot (event) recorded.</LI>

      <LI>Timestamp - the "wall-clock" time of the event. If the debugger doesn't give an event
      time, or the snapshot does not correspond to an event, then it is the snapshot creation
      time.</LI>

      <LI>Event Thread - the thread that caused the event, if applicable. In the case of thread
      creation, this should probably be the spawned thread, not the parent.</LI>

      <LI>Schedule - if applicable, a source snap and the stepping schedule which produces this
      snapshot. This always applies to <EM>scratch</EM> snapshots produced by emulation, but may
      (rarely) apply to recorded events if the stepping schedule between them is somehow known. See
      the <A href="#goto_time">Go To Time</A> action for a description of the notation.</LI>

      <LI>Description - a user-modifiable description of the snapshot or event. This defaults to
      the debugger's description of the event.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <H3><A name="rename_snapshot"></A>Rename Snapshot</H3>

    <P>This action is available in the <SPAN class="menu">Debugger</SPAN> menu whenever the focused
    window has an associated snapshot. It will prompt for a new description for the current
    snapshot. This is a shortcut to modifying the description in the time table, but can be
    accessed outside of the time window.</P>

    <H3><A name="goto_time"></A>Go To Time</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a trace is active. It prompts for a <EM>time schedule</EM>. In
    many cases, it is simply the snapshot number, e.g., <CODE>3</CODE>, which will go to the
    snapshot with key 3. It may optionally include an emulation schedule. For example,
    <CODE>3:10</CODE> will use snapshot 3 for an emulator's initial state and step 10 machine
    instructions on snapshot 3's event thread. If the snapshot does not give an event thread, then
    the thread must be specified in the expression, e.g., <CODE>3:t1-10</CODE>. That expression
    will start at snapshot 3, get the thread with key 1, and step it 10 machine instructions. The
    stepping commands can be repeated any number of times, separated by semicolons, to step threads
    in a specified sequence. For example, <CODE>3:t1-10;t2-5</CODE> will do the same as before,
    then get thread 2 and step it 5 times.</P>

    <P>The emulator's state can also be patched by the schedule. Instead of specifying the number
    of steps, write a <EM>Sleigh</EM> statement, e.g., <CODE>3:t1-{r0=0x1234};10</CODE>. This will
    start at snapshot 3, patch thread 1's r0 to 0x1234, then step 10 instructions. As for steps,
    the thread key may be omitted for Sleigh commands. Each command without a thread specified
    implicitly uses the one from the previous command, or in the case of the first command, the
    event thread. Only one Sleigh statement is permitted per command.</P>

    <P>A second command sequence may be appended, following a dot, to command the emulator at the
    level of p-code operations as well. This is particularly useful when debugging a processor
    specification. See the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerPcodeStepperPlugin/DebuggerPcodeStepperPlugin.html">P-code Stepper</A>
    window. For example, <CODE>3:2.10</CODE> will start at snapshot 3 and step the event thread 2
    machine instructions then 10 p-code operations. The same thread-by-thread sequencing and state
    patching commands are allowed in the p-code command sequence. <B>NOTE:</B> the entire
    instruction sequence precedes the entire p-code sequence, i.e., only a single dot is allowed.
    Once the schedule enters p-code mode, it cannot re-enter instruction mode.</P>

    <H3><A name="hide_scratch"></A>Hide Scratch</H3>

    <P>This toggle action is always available in the drop-down actions of the Time window. It is
    enabled by default. The emulation service, which enables trace extrapolation and interpolation,
    writes emulated state into the trace's <EM>scratch space</EM>, which comprises all negative
    snaps. When this toggle is enabled, those snapshots are hidden. They can be displayed by
    disabling this toggle. Note that navigating into scratch space may cause temporary undefined
    behavior in some windows, and may prevent interaction with the target.</P>
