    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=

    <P>A static mapping refers to a range of addresses in the dynamic listing and its corresponding
    range in the static listing. These mappings provide a flexible means of mapping imported
    images, i.e., Ghidra Program Databases, into a trace. Typically, this table is populated by
    automation, e.g., the <A href="help/topics/DebuggerBots/DebuggerBots.html#map_modules">Map
    Modules</A> bot, or by higher-level user actions, e.g., the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerModulesPlugin/DebuggerModulesPlugin.html#map_modules">Map Modules</A>
    action. This under-the-hood static mapping window displays the mappings table, allowing users or
    developers to diagnose image mapping issues and manually add mappings, regardless of reported
    modules and/or sections. For most users, there is no reason to access this window.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Dynamic Address - the minimum address in the dynamic address range.</LI>

      <LI>Static Program - the Ghidra URL of the imported static image.</LI>

      <LI>Static Address - the minimum address in the static address range.</LI>

      <LI>Length - the number of bytes in each address range.</LI>

      <LI>Shift - the offset from static address to dynamic address.</LI>

      <LI>Lifespan - the span of time for which this mapping is applicable.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>This window provides actions for finding, adding, and removing mappings. Note that entries
    cannot be modified.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_rows"></A>Select Rows</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the active listing's (dynamic or static) cursor is at a valid
    location. It selects the mapping containing that cursor. If the active listing has a selection,
    it selects all mappings intersecting that selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="add"></A>Add Mapping</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It presents a dialog to manually add a mapping. When one
    primary listing (dynamic or static) has a selection, and the other's cursor is at a valid
    location, it will populate the dialog, using the selection's size and minimum address, and the
    cursor as the corresponding minimum address. The default lifespan is "from now on out", i.e.,
    the current snap to infinity.</P>

    <H3><A name="remove"></A>Remove Mapping</H3>

    <P>This action is available when at least one mapping is selected. It removes those
    mappings.</P>
