    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Control and Machine State</H1>

    <P>This plugin presents actions for controlling targets and modifying machine state. It
    provides a drop-down action in the main toolbar for choosing what to control for the current
    target: The live target, the integrated emulator, or the recorded trace. Only those control
    actions suitable for the selection are displayed. Machine-state edits throughout the UI are
    directed accordingly.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The plugin provides several actions, but only certain ones are displayed, depending on the
    current mode.</P>

    <H3><A name="edit_mode"></A>Edit Mode</H3>

    <P>This action changes the mode for the active trace and, if applicable, its associated live
    target. It is always displayed, but only available when a trace is active. The possible modes
    are:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/write-disabled.png"> Control Target w/Edits Disabled - This
      presents actions for controlling the live target but rejects all machine-state edits.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/write-target.png"> Control Target - The default, this presents
      actions for controlling the live target and directs edits to the live target. To accept
      edits, the UI must be "live and at the present." If the trace has no associated target, i.e.,
      it is dead; or if the current view is in the past or includes any steps of emulation, i.e.,
      it is not at the present; then edits are rejected.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/write-trace.png"> Control Trace - This presents actions for
      navigating trace snapshots. It directs all edits to the trace database. Edits are generally
      always accepted, and they are applied directly to the trace.</LI>

      <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/write-emulator.png"> Control Emulator - This presents actions for
      controlling the integrated emulator. This can be used for interpolating and extrapolating
      execution from the current snapshot, without affecting the live target. It directs edits to
      the integrated emulator by generating patch steps and appending them to the emulation
      schedule. See the <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerThreadsPlugin/DebuggerThreadsPlugin.html#goto_time">Go To Time</A>
      action. Essentially, the change is applied in the trace's scratch space, leaving the original
      recording in tact. Due to implementation details, a thread must be selected, even if edits
      only affect memory. Additionally, the disassembly context register cannot be modified.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Target Control Actions</H2>

    <P>These actions are visible when the "Control Target" or "Control Target w/Edits Disabled"
    mode is selected. They are available only when the current trace has an associated live target.
    Commands are directed to the focused object or a suitable substitute.</P>

    <H3><A name="target_resume"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/resume.png"> Resume</H3>

    <P>Allow the current target to resume execution. Other debuggers may call this "continue" or
    "go." If successful, the target enters the "running" state until/if it is interrupted or
    terminated. This is available when the target is currently stopped.</P>

    <H3><A name="target_interrupt"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/interrupt.png"> Interrupt</H3>

    <P>Interrupt the current target's execution. Other debuggers may call this "break," "suspend,"
    or "stop." If successful, the target enters the "stopped" state. This is available when the
    target is currently running.</P>

    <H3><A name="target_kill"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/kill.png"> Kill</H3>

    <P>Kill the current target. Other debuggers may call this "terminate" or "stop." By default,
    this will consequently close the current trace. If successful, the target enters the
    "terminated" state. This is always available for a live target.</P>

    <H3><A name="target_disconnect"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/disconnect.png"> Disconnect</H3>

    <P>Disconnect from the current target's debugger. This usually causes the connected debugger to
    terminate and likely kill its targets. By default, this will consequently close the trace for
    all affected targets. This is always available for a live target.</P>

    <H3><A name="target_step_into"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepinto.png"> Step Into</H3>

    <P>Step the current target to the next instruction. This is available when the target is
    currently stopped. If successful the target may briefly enter the "running" state.</P>

    <H3><A name="target_step_over"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepover.png"> Step Over</H3>

    <P>Step the current target to the next instruction in the current subroutine. This is available
    when the target is currently stopped. If successful the target may briefly enter the "running"
    state.</P>

    <H3><A name="target_step_finish"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepout.png"> Finish</H3>

    <P>Allow the current target to finish the current subroutine, pausing after. This is available
    when the target is currently stopped. If successful the target may briefly enter the "running"
    state.</P>

    <H3><A name="target_step_last"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/steplast.png"> Step Repeat Last /
    Extended</H3>

    <P>Perform a target-defined step, often the last (possibly custom or extended) step. This is
    available when the target is currently stopped. If successful the target may briefly enter the
    "running" state.</P>

    <H2>Trace Navigation Actions</H2>

    <P>These actions are visible when the "Control Trace" mode is selected. They are available when
    there is an active trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="trace_snap_backward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/2leftarrow.png" width="16">
    Snapshot Backward</H3>

    <P>This navigates the trace backward one snapshot. All windows displaying machine state will
    show that recorded in the current snapshot. This is available only when there exists a snapshot
    previous to the current.</P>

    <H3><A name="trace_snap_forward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/2rightarrow.png" width="16">
    Snapshot Forward</H3>

    <P>This nativates the trace forward one snapshot. All windows displaying machine state will
    show that recorded in the current snapshot. This is available only when there exists a snapshot
    after the current.</P>

    <H2>Emulation Actions</H2>

    <P>These actions are visible when the "Control Emulator" mode is selected. They are available
    when there is an active trace. Commands are directed to the integrated emulator for the current
    trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="emu_resume"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/resume.png"> Resume</H3>

    <P>Allow the emulator to resume execution. This is available when no other integrated emulator
    is running. A monitor dialog is presented during execution, but the GUI remains responsive.
    Only one emulator can be run from the GUI at a time. If the current snapshot represents the
    live target, the emulator may read additional machine state from the live target. For
    non-contrived programs, the emulator will likely be interrupted, since some instructions and
    all system calls are not yet supported. It could also start executing from unmapped memory or
    enter a infinite loop. If it seems to carry on too long, interrupt it and examine.</P>

    <H3><A name="emu_interrupt"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/interrupt.png"> Interrupt</H3>

    <P>Interrupt the currently-running emulator. This is available when any integrated emulator is
    running. In most cases, this is the emulator for the current trace, but it may not be.
    Canceling the dialog for an emulation task will also interrupt the emulator. Upon interruption,
    the emulation schedule is recorded and the snapshot displayed in the GUI.</P>

    <H3><A name="emu_step_back"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepback.png"> Step Back</H3>

    <P>Steps the emulator to the previous instruction, by flow. This is available when the current
    snapshot includes emulated steps. This operates by repeating the current emulation schedule
    with one less step. Thus, it effectively steps backward, heeding the proper control flow. While
    not common, if emulation to the current snapshot took a good bit of time, then stepping
    backward will likely take about the same amount of time.</P>

    <H3><A name="emu_step_into"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepinto.png"> Step Into</H3>

    <P>Steps the emulator to the next instruction, by flow. This is available when there is an
    active thread. At worst, this operates by repeating the current emulation schedule with one
    more step of the current thread. In most cases, this can use the cached emulator for the
    current snapshot and advanced it a single step. Note that "Step Over" is not currently
    supported by the emulator.</P>

    <H3><A name="emu_skip_over"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/skipover.png"> Skip Over</H3>

    <P>Skips the emulator over the current instruction, ignoring flow. This is available when there
    is an active thread. At worst, this operates by repeating the current emulation schedule with
    an added skip for the current thread. In most cases, this can use the cached emulator for the
    current snapshot and advance it by skipping once. Note that this <EM>skips</EM> the
    instruction. Thus, when used on a "call" instruction, all effects and side-effects of the
    subroutine are averted. This is not the same as "<EM>Step</EM> Over," which is not currently
    supported by the emulator.</P>

    <H2>Recommendations</H2>

    <P>Write Target is the default mode, because in most cases, this is the desired behavior. When
    the target dies, Write Target essentially means Read Only. For the most part, modifying the
    recording itself is discouraged. There are few reasons, perhaps including 1) Hand-generating an
    experimental trace; 2) Generating a trace from a script, e.g., importing an event log,
    recording an emulated target; 3) Patching in state missed by the original recording. Be wary
    when switching from emulation to trace mode, since you could accidentally edit scratch space in
    the trace. It is allowed but can produce non-intuitive and erroneous results, since the
    emulator caches its snapshots in scratch space.</P>

    <P>To prevent accidental edits to a live target, use the Control Target w/Edits Disabled mode.
    This is only effective against edits from the UI, and only when all plugins and scripts use the
    state editing service. This cannot prevent a component from accessing Ghidra's Target API to
    modify a target. Nor can it prevent edits via the connected debugger's command-line
    interpreter. The following components all use the service: <A href=

    "help/topics/DebuggerMemoryBytesPlugin/DebuggerMemoryBytesPlugin.html">Memory (Dynamic
    Bytes)</A>, <A href=
