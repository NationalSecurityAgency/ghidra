    <P>The stack window displays the current trace's execution stack, as unwound and reported by
    the target. Not all debuggers will unwind the stack, in which case, this window displays only
    the innermost frame. When emulation is used to generate the current machine state, only a
    single synthetic frame is shown. Level 0 always refers to the innermost frame, and each
    incremental level refers to the next caller in the chain &mdash; most of the time. The current
    frame comprises one element of the tool's current "coordinates." Selecting a frame changes
    those coordinates, potentially causing other windows to display different information. Namely,
    the <A href="help/topics/DebuggerRegistersPlugin/DebuggerRegistersPlugin.html">Registers</A>
    window will show registers for the current frame, assuming they can be retrieved. The Listings
    may also navigate to the current frame's program counter.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The stack table has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Level - the level of the frame, counting 0-up starting at the innermost frame.</LI>

      <LI>PC - the address of the instruction to execute next, or upon return of the callee for
      non-0 frames. Different platforms may have different subtleties in how they report PC.
      Double-clicking this field will navigate to the address.</LI>

      <LI>Function - the name of the containing function, if Ghidra has the corresponding module
      image imported and analyzed.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - a user-modifiable comment.</LI>
