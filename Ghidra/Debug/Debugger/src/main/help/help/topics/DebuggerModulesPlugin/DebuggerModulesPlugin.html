    <P>The concept of a module may vary from platform to platform, but in most cases, it refers to
    a binary image which is loaded or mapped into memory comprising some portion of the target's
    executable code. Likely, these are the same files that Ghidra can import for static analysis.
    Similarly, the concept of a section may vary, but in most cases, it refers to a portion of a
    module, possibly backed by its binary image. This window displays information about modules,
    and sometimes their sections, known to the connected debugger. Information in this window
    reflects what has been recorded into the current trace, which in turn comes from a target. The
    top table displays module information, while the bottom table displays section information.</P>

    <H2>Table Columns</H2>

    <P>The top table, which lists modules, has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Base Address - if available, the minimum address where the module is mapped in the
      target's memory. Double-clicking this field navigates to the address.</LI>

      <LI>Max Address - if available, the maximum address where the module is mapped in the
      target's memory. Double-clicking this field navigates to the address.</LI>

      <LI>Name - a short name for the module, typically its file name.</LI>

      <LI>Module Name - the name of the module, ideally its full path on the target's
      filesystem.</LI>

      <LI>Lifespan - denotes the recorded load and unload times of the module, i.e., the span of
      time for which the module record is applicable.</LI>

      <LI>Length - the length from base address to max address, inclusive. Note that not every page
      in the range is necessarily mapped.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The bottom table, which lists sections, has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Start Address - the minimum virtual memory address of the section. Double-clicking this
      field navigates to the address.</LI>

      <LI>End Address - the maximum virtual memory address of the section. Double-clicking this
      field navigates to the address.</LI>

      <LI>Section Name - the name of the section given by the debugger, usually the same as the
      name given in the module's header.</LI>

      <LI>Module Name - the name of the module containing this section.</LI>

      <LI>Length - the number of bytes in the section.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>This window provides several actions, some of which are only accessible via pop-up
    menus.</P>

    <H3><A name="import_from_fs"></A>Import From File System</H3>

    <P>This action is available from a module's or section's pop-up menu. It prompts the user to
    import the module from the local file system into Ghidra as a static image.</P>

    <H3><A name="auto_map"></A>Auto-Map</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It automatically maps trace memory to static images, using
    Module, Section, or Region information. See the <A href="#map_modules">Map Modules</A>, <A
    href="#map_sections">Map Sections</A>, and <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerRegionsPlugin/DebuggerRegionsPlugin.html#map_regions">Map Regions</A>
    actions for more information. When enabled, this action will automatically perform the
    corresponding action whenever the relevant table is updated. By default, it automatically maps
    using Modules.</P>

    <H3><A name="map_identically"></A>Map Identically</H3>

    <P>This action is available when both a trace and a program are opened. It maps the current
    trace to the current program using identical addresses. This action ignores the module list. It
    is a suitable mapping when the current program is loaded in the trace <EM>without
    relocation</EM>. It is also a fallback worth trying in the absence of a module list.</P>

    <H3><A name="map_manually"></A>Map Manually</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It simply displays the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window. From there, it is possible to construct the map from trace memory to static images
    entirely by hand.</P>

    <H3><A name="map_modules"></A>Map Modules</H3>

    <P>This action is available from the modules' or sections' pop-up menu. It searches the tool's
    open programs for the selected modules and proposes new mappings. The user can examine and
    tweak the proposal before confirming or canceling it. Typically, this is done automatically by
    the <A href="#auto_map">Auto-Map</A> action. By selecting "Memorize" and confirming the dialog,
    the user can cause the mapper to re-use the memorized mapping in future sessions. The memorized
    module name is saved to the program database.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src=
          "images/DebuggerModuleMapProposalDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <H3><A name="map_module_to"></A>Map Module to Current Program</H3>

    <P>This action is available from a single module's pop-up menu, when there is an open program.
    It behaves like Map Modules, except that it will propose the selected module be mapped to the
    current program. This action with the "Memorize" toggle is a good way to override or specify a
    module mapping once and for all.</P>

    <H3><A name="map_sections"></A>Map Sections</H3>

    <P>This action is analogous to the Map Modules action. It searches the tool's open programs for
    blocks matching the selected sections and proposes new mappings. Users who prefer this to Map
    Modules should also consider setting <A href="#auto_map">Auto-Map</A> to use Sections.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src=
          "images/DebuggerSectionMapProposalDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <H3><A name="map_sections_to"></A>Map Sections to Current Program</H3>

    <P>This action is available from the pop-up menu, when the current selection indicates a single
    module and there is an open program. It behaves like Map Sections, except that it will attempt
    to map sections from the indicated module to blocks in the current program.</P>

    <H3><A name="map_section_to"></A>Map Section to Current Block</H3>

    <P>This action is available from a single section's pop-up menu, when there is an open program.
    It behaves like Map Sections, except that it will propose the selected section be mapped to the
    block containing the cursor in the static listing.</P>

    <H3><A name="import_missing_module"></A>Import Missing Module</H3>

    <P>This action is offered to resolve a "missing module" console message. It is equivalent to <A
    href="#import_from_fs">Import From File System</A> on the missing module.</P>

    <H3><A name="map_missing_module"></A>Map Missing Module</H3>

    <P>This action is offered to resolve a "missing module" console message. It is equivalent to <A
    href="#map_module_to">Map Module To</A> on the missing module.</P>

    <H3><A name="show_sections_table"></A>Show Sections Table</H3>

    <P>This actions is always available. By default the sections table (bottom) is showing. Some
    debuggers do not offer section information, and even for those that do, it can be expensive to
    retrieve it. The visibility of the section table is controlled by toggling this action.</P>

    <H3><A name="filter_by_module"></A>Filter Sections by Module</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. By default the bottom table displays all sections in the
    current trace. When this toggle is enabled, and at least one module is selected, the bottom
    table will only include sections contained by a selected module.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_addresses"></A>Select Addresses</H3>

    <P>This action is available when at least one module or section is selected. It selects all
    addresses in the dynamic listing contained by the selected modules or sections.</P>

    <H3><A name="select_rows"></A>Select Rows</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the dynamic listing's cursor is at a valid location. It
    selects the module and section, if applicable, containing that cursor. If the dynamic listing
    has a selection, it selects all modules and sections intersecting that selection.</P>
