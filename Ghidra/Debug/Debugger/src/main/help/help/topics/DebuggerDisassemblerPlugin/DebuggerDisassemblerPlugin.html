    <H1>Debugger: Disassembler and Assembler</H1>

    <P>The Debugger provides specialized disassemble and assemble ("patch instruction") actions.
    These actions operate on a smaller scope of instructions, disassembling linearly from the
    cursor or program counter up to and including the next branching instruction. They also allow
    the user a selection of languages configured on the current trace.</P>

    <H2>Actions:</H2>

    <H3><A name="disassemble"></A> Disassemble</H3>

    <P>This action disassembles from the cursor up to the next branching instruction for the
    selected language. One action is presented per language configured at the current location.
    Other languages may also be presented if the only thing that varies is the default disassembly
    context, e.g., configuring ARM will also allow THUMB disassembly.</P>

    <H3><A name="patch_instruction"></A> Patch Instruction / Assemble</H3>

    <P>This action assembles an instruction at the cursor. One action is presented per language
    configured at the current location. Other languages may also be presented if the only thing
    that varies is the default disassembly context, e.g., configuring ARM will also allow THUMB
    assembly.</P>
