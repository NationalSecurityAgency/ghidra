    </TABLE>

    <P><A name="Toggle_Header"></A>The dynamic listing is analogous to Ghidra's listing for static
    analysis, but in the dynamic context. It displays annotated memory contents from a target. More
    precisely, it displays recorded memory contents in a trace. In most use cases, that trace is
    "at the present," meaning it is the most recent memory from a live target. Multiple listings
    can be displayed simultaneously, using the same pattern as many other Ghidra windows. The
    "primary" listing is always displayed and generally tracks with the rest of the tool. Any
    listing can be "snapshotted," i.e., cloned. This is where dynamic listings differ from static
    listings. Static clones remain in place; they do not automatically navigate. Dynamic clones can
    still be configured to navigate, following the rest of the tool. A common use is to configure a
    clone to follow the stack pointer. Still, you can disable a listing's automatic navigation, so
    it behaves like a true clone. A current limitation is that you cannot use clones to display
    different points in time for the same trace.</P>

    <P>Where applicable, the static listing's location is synchronized to the dynamic listing, and
    vice versa. The dynamic listing permits most of the same mark-up as the static listing. Any
    mark-up added to the dynamic listing is saved to the trace. All mark-up (and nearly all trace
    record types, for that matter) have a location in space and time. That is, they occupy an
    address range (like mark-up in Ghidra programs), but also a time range (unique to traces). When
    mark-up is added to the listing, it exists "from this time on". That is, its time interval is
    from the current time to infinity, i.e., it has been created but never destroyed. When mark-up
    is removed from the listing, its "destruction time" is set to just before the current time. If
    this would cause the mark-up to "never exist," i.e., its destruction time precedes its creation
    time, then the record is deleted altogether. This yields a mostly-intuitive mechanism for
    marking things up "in time," but the fact that mark-up is bound in time can still be
    surprising. For example, disassembling some instructions and then stepping back in time will
    cause that disassembly to disappear.</P>

    <P>Because not all memory is recorded, some background coloring is used to indicate the state
    of attempted memory reads. Regardless of state, the most-recent contents, as recorded in the
    trace, are displayed in the listing, defaulting to 00. "Stale" memory, that is ranges of memory
    which have not been read at the current time, are displayed with a darker background. Where
    that memory is marked "read-only" and has been successfully read previously, that coloring is
    subdued, since the contents are not likely to have changed. Where a read was attempted but
    failed, the first address in the failed range is displayed with a pink background. Otherwise,
    up-to-date contents are displayed with the default background color.</P>

    <P>The dynamic listing supports editing memory. See <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerControlPlugin/DebuggerControlPlugin.html">Control and Machine State</A>.
    Such edits are performed as usual: Via the <A href=
    "help/topics/AssemblerPlugin/Assembler.htm">Patch</A> actions, or by pasting byte strings.
    These edits may be directed toward a live target, the trace, or the emulator.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The listing provides a variety of actions, some for managing and configuring listings, and
    others for capturing memory from a target.</P>

    <H3><A name="new_listing"></A>New Dynamic Listing</H3>

    <P>This action is always available in the <SPAN class="menu">Window &rarr; Debugger</SPAN>
    menu. It creates a new listing window with the same configuration as the primary dynamic
    listing. It is equivalent to cloning the primary dynamic listing.</P>

    <H3><A name="export_view"></A>Export Trace View</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever there is a trace open in the listing. It is analogous to
    "Export Program," but for the current trace at the current time. This provides a mechanism for
    capturing a particular point in time from a trace as a static image. The exported image can be
    analyzed in Ghidra or another tool.</P>

    <H3><A name="follows_thread"></A>Follows Selected Thread</H3>

    <P>This action is only available on cloned dynamic listings. The primary listing always follows
    the tool's current thread. Disabling this toggle causes the clone to remain on its own current
    thread rather than following the tool's. The current thread is used when computing a location
    to navigate to automatically. It is only applicable when "Track Location" is set to something
    other than "Do Not Track."</P>

    <H3><A name="track_location"></A>Track Location</H3>

    <P>This action is always available on all dynamic listings. It configures automatic navigation
    for the dynamic listing. When location tracking is enabled, the listing is automatically
    navigated to an address computed from the trace's or target's machine state. The address is
    displayed in the top right of the viewer. That address and its corresponding static address are
    also highlighted in green in the listing. If the address cannot be located in the listing, the
    address is displayed in red. The computed address is affected by the tool's current
    "coordinates," that is the selected thread, frame, and point in time. The options are
    pluggable, but currently consist of:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Do Not Track - disables automatic navigation.</LI>

      <LI>Track Program Counter - (default) navigates this listing to the current program counter.
      If the stack contains a record of the program counter, it is preferred to the recorded
      register value. Note that debuggers may vary in how they report the program counter, and its
      meaning may vary among platforms. While there may be some nuances to the register value, the
      value recorded in the stack should indicate the next instruction to be executed.</LI>

      <LI>Track Program Counter (by stack) - navigates this listing to the current program counter
      as recorded from the debugger's stack trace. This option is not recommended for regular use,
      especially for emulation, since the emulator does not provide stack trace records. Its use is
      recommended for debugger connection developers to verify the stack records are being properly
      interpreted by the GUI.</LI>

      <LI>Track Program Counter (by register) - navigates this listing to the current program
      counter as recorded from the registers. While suitable for regular use, the default "Track
      Program Counter" option is recommended, since the stack may record the program counter in
      some cases where the registers do not. For example, when unwinding a stack frame, the
      debugger may report the frame's program counter without reporting the frame's registers. This
      option may be desired if stack frames are recorded incorrectly.</LI>

      <LI>Track Stack Pointer - navigates this listing to the current stack pointer. Note that
      platforms may vary in how they define the stack pointer.</LI>

      <LI>Track address of watch - navigates this listing to the address of the expression's value.
      This option is replicated for each watch in the <A href=
      "help/topics/DebuggerWatchesPlugin/DebuggerWatchesPlugin.html">Watches</A> window.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H3><A name="go_to"></A>Go To (G)</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever a trace is active in the listing. It prompts the user for
    an address, which can be expressed in simple notation or <B>Sleigh</B>, then attempts to
    navigate to it. The expression is evaluated in the context of the current thread, frame, and
    point in time. If the current trace is live and at the present, the target may be queried to
    retrieve any machine state required to evaluate the expression. The expression may be in terms
    of labels, registers, and constants. Labels may come from the current trace or a program mapped
    into the trace. Ambiguities are resolved arbitrarily.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center" width="100%"><IMG alt="" src="images/DebuggerGoToDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>Some examples:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><CODE>00401234</CODE> &mdash; A constant address in simple notation</LI>

      <LI><CODE>0x00401234:8</CODE> &mdash; A constant address in Sleigh notation</LI>

      <LI><CODE>main + 10</CODE> &mdash; 10 bytes past the address of "main"</LI>

      <LI><CODE>RAX</CODE> &mdash; The address in RAX</LI>

      <LI><CODE>RSP + 8</CODE> &mdash; The address of stack offset 8</LI>

      <LI><CODE>*:8 (RSP+8)</CODE> &mdash; The address pointed to by stack offset 8</LI>
    </UL>

    <H3><A name="auto_sync_cursor_static"></A>Auto-Sync Cursor with Static Listing</H3>

    <P>This action is always available, but only on the primary dynamic listing. It configures
    location synchronization with the (primary) static listing. When enabled, navigation in either
    listing &mdash; including automatic navigation &mdash; automatically navigates to the
    corresponding location, if applicable, in the other. In general, "corresponding location" is
    computed using information about loaded modules reported by the debugger. For the finer
    details, see the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window. When you navigate to a location contained by a module, but there is no corresponding
    static location, the listing logs a "missing module" to the console, offering either to import
    the module or map it to an existing program. If the cursor cannot be mapped, the other
    listing's location is left unchanged. If this does not seem correct. Check your module list and
    static mappings.</P>

    <H3><A name="auto_sync_selection_static"></A>Auto-Sync Selection with Static Listing</H3>

    <P>This action is always available, but only on the primary dynamic listing. It configures
    selection synchronization with the (primary) static listing. When enabled, selection in either
    listing automatically selects the corresponding ranges, if applicable, in the other. In
    general, "corresponding ranges" are computed using information about loaded modules reported by
    the debugger. For the finer details, see the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window. Portions of the selection which cannot be mapped are omitted.</P>

    <H3><A name="sync_selection_into_static"></A>Sync Selection Here into Static Listing</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever the current context is dynamic and has a selection. It
    maps the current dynamic selection to corresponding static ranges and selects those in the
    static listing. In general, "corresponding ranges" are computed using information about loaded
    modules reported by the debugger. For the finer details, see the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window. Portions of the selection which cannot be mapped are omitted. If no part of the
    selection is mappable, an error is displayed in the status bar. This can happen if the module
    list is missing, or Ghidra could not find the program for the current module.</P>

    <H3><A name="sync_selection_from_static"></A>Sync Selection Here from Static Listing</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever the current context is static and has a selection. It maps
    the current static selection to corresponding dynamic ranges and selects those in the dynamic
    listing. In general, "corresponding ranges" are computed using information about loaded modules
    reported by the debugger. For the finer details, see the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window. Portions of the selection which cannot be mapped are omitted. If no part of the
    selection is mappable, an error is displayed in the status bar. This can happen if the module
    list is missing, or Ghidra could not find the program for the current module.</P>

    <H3><A name="open_program"></A>Open Program</H3>

    <P>This action is offered as a resolution whenever a module cannot be automatically opened.
    This typically happens when the module's program database has crash data that can be recovered
    and/or needs a version upgrade. It will attempt to open the program, allowing Ghidra to prompt
    you about the situation.</P>

    <H3><A name="read_memory"></A>Read Memory</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the current trace is "at the present" with a live target, and
    there is a selection of addresses in the dynamic listing. It will instruct the recorder to read
    and record the contents of memory for the selected range(s). Typically, the viewable addresses
    are automatically read, anyway &mdash; see the Auto-Read action.</P>

    <H3><A name="auto_memory"></A>Auto-Read Memory</H3>

    <P>This action is always available on all dynamic listings. It configures whether or not the
    memory range(s) displayed in the listing are automatically read and recorded. Like the Read
    Memory action, it is only permitted when the current trace is "at the present" with a live
    target. It occurs when the user scrolls the listing, or when the listing is otherwise navigated
    to a new location. Note that other components may read memory, regardless of this listing's
    configuration. For example, the recorder typically reads the page of memory pointed to by the
    program counter. In other words, this action <EM>cannot</EM> "disable all memory reads." The
    options are pluggable, but currently consist of:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Do Not Read Memory - disables automatic memory reads <EM>for this listing only</EM>.</LI>

      <LI>Read Visible Memory - automatically reads stale ranges that enter this listing's
      view.</LI>

      <LI>Read Visible Memory, RO Once - (default) behaves like Read Visible Memory, except it will
      neglect read-only ranges that have been read previously.</LI>
    </UL>
