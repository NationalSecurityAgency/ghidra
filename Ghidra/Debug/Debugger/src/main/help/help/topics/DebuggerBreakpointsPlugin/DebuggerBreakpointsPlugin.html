    <DIV class="image">

    </DIV>

    <P>The breakpoints window tabulates and manipulates breakpoints among all traces, including
    live targets. Only address-based breakpoints are tabulated. For other traps, e.g., "break on
    exception," see the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerModelPlugin/DebuggerModelPlugin.html">Model</A> window. Breakpoints can
    also be manipulated from address-based views, especially the disassembly listings. See <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Breakpoints in
    the Listings</A>.</P>

    <P>Individual breakpoint locations from among the traces are consolidated into logical
    breakpoints, based on their addresses in the static listing. The current breakpoint set
    comprises the static locations, stored as bookmarks in their respective program databases. See
    the <A href="help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static
    Mappings</A> window for the finer details of address mapping. A breakpoint which cannot be
    mapped to a static address becomes its own logical breakpoint at its dynamic address. The top
    table of the provider displays logical breakpoints; the bottom table displays individual
    breakpoint locations. <B>NOTE:</B> Only those breakpoints visible at the current snapshot of
    each trace are included. For live targets, this is typically the latest snapshot, i.e., the
    present.</P>

    <P>Depending on what is supported by the connected debugger, breakpoints can trap a target when
    an address or range is executed, read, or written; using software or hardware mechanisms. In
    the case of <EM>read</EM> or <EM>write</EM> breakpoints, debuggers may differ in terminology.
    For example, GDB might call them <EM>watchpoints</EM>, but Ghidra still calls these
    <EM>breakpoints</EM>. Some debuggers allow the user to specify a breakpoint location other than
    by address, but ultimately each specification is realized by 0 or more addressable locations.
    To accommodate this, the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerModelPlugin/DebuggerModelPlugin.html">Model</A> window will typically
    display a list of specifications, each listing its locations as children. However, the grouping
    of breakpoint locations into logical breakpoints by Ghidra's breakpoint manager is done
    <EM>without respect to</EM> the debugger's specifications. A specification may be at a higher
    stratum than Ghidra natively understands, e.g., the source filename and line number, and so
    such specifications are not relevant. Also note that the debugger might not permit locations to
    be toggled independently of their specifications. This may limit how Ghidra can operate, since
    in that case, it must toggle the specification, which may affect more locations than
    intended.</P>

    <P>When the <A href="help/topics/DebuggerControlPlugin/DebuggerControlPlugin.html">control
    mode</A> is set to <B>Trace</B> or <B>Emulator</B>, it is possible to rewind the trace to past
    snapshots and examine old breakpoints. You may also emulate from those snapshots, even if the
    target is no longer alive. By default, those historical breakpoints are disabled in the
    integrated emulator, but they can be toggled in the usual ways. In addition, the locations can
    be manipulated independently, since the emulator has its own breakpoint set. Emulated
    breakpoints can be configured with conditions expressed in Sleigh using the <A href=
    "#set_condition">Set Condition</A> action, or configured to replace the instruction's semantics
    altogether using the <A href="#set_injection">Set Injection</A> action.</P>

    <P>Because of the logical grouping of breakpoints, it is possible for a breakpoint to be in a
    mixed or inconsistent state. This happens quite commonly, e.g., when a breakpoint is placed in
    the Static Listing before that program is mapped to any trace. Once mapped, the dynamic
    location of that breakpoint is computed and noted as missing. A logical breakpoint without any
    location in a target is called <EM>ineffective</EM> and is drawn in grey, e.g.: <IMG alt=""
    src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.marker.ineffective.enabled">. An enabled logical breakpoint
    having a disabled location is called <EM>inconsistent</EM> and its icon will include an
    exclamation mark: <IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.overlay.inconsistent">. A disabled
    logical breakpoint having an enabled location is similarly inconsistent. Toggling an
    ineffective or inconsistent logical breakpoint enables and/or places all its mapped locations,
    aiming for a consistent enabled state. Toggling it again disables all locations.</P>

    <H2>Tables and Columns</H2>

    <P>The top table, which lists logical breakpoints, has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>State - displays an icon indicating the state of the breakpoint. If rendered in grey, the
      breakpoint has no locations, i.e., it is ineffective. If rendered with an exclamation mark
      overlay, the breakpoint is inconsistent. Clicking the icon toggles the breakpoint.</LI>

        <UL style="list-style-type: none">
          <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.marker.enabled"> <B>Enabled:</B> The
          logical breakpoint, including all its locations, is enabled.</LI>

          <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.marker.disabled"> <B>Disabled:</B> The
          logical breakpoint, including all its locations, is disabled.</LI>

          <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.marker.mixed"> <B>Mixed:</B> (<A href=
          "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Listing</A>
          only) Two logical breakpoints at the same address have different states.</LI>
        </UL>

      <LI>Name - gives the user-defined name of the breakpoint. This cell is only populated and
      modifiable when the breakpoint is bookmarked in a program, since the name is associated with
      the static location.</LI>

      <LI>Address - gives the address of the breakpoint. This is typically the static address. If
      the breakpoint cannot be mapped to a static address, this is its dynamic address.</LI>

      <LI>Image - gives the name of the static image, i.e., Ghidra program. If the breakpoint
      cannot be mapped to a static location, this is blank.</LI>

      <LI>Length - usually 1. For access breakpoints, this is the length in bytes of the address
      range.</LI>

      <LI>Kinds - indicates the kind(s) of breakpoint: SW_EXECUTE, HW_EXECUTE, READ, and/or
      WRITE.</LI>

      <LI>Locations - counts the number of locations included in this logical breakpoint, applying
      the trace filter if active. Note that a logical breakpoint with 0 locations is
      ineffective.</LI>

      <LI>Sleigh - indicates whether or not the breakpoint has a customized Sleigh configuration.
      This is only relevant for emulation.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The bottom table, which lists breakpoint locations, has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>State - displays an icon indicating the state of the location. If rendered with an
      exclamation mark overlay, the location does not agree with its logical breakpoint, or it
      cannot be bookmarked. Clicking the icon toggles the location.</LI>

        <UL style="list-style-type: none">
          <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.marker.enabled"> <B>Enabled:</B> The
          location is enabled.</LI>

          <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.marker.disabled"> <B>Disabled:</B> The
          location is disabled.</LI>

          <LI><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.marker.mixed"> <B>Mixed:</B> (<A href=
          "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Listing</A>
          only) Two locations at the same address have different states.</LI>
        </UL>

      <LI>Name - displays the name given to the location by the connected debugger. This field is
      user modifiable.</LI>

      <LI>Address - gives the dynamic address of this location.</LI>

      <LI>Trace - gives the name of the location's trace.</LI>

      <LI>Threads - (hidden by default) if the breakpoint applies to a limited set of threads,
      gives the list of threads.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - gives a user comment &mdash; the specification's expression by default. This
      field is user modifiable.</LI>

      <LI>Sleigh - indicates whether or not the location has a customized Sleigh configuration.
      This is only relevant for emulation.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Breakpoint Actions</H2>

    <P>The primary purpose of this provider is to manipulate existing breakpoints. It provides the
    following actions to that end. Breakpoints can also be managed via the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Breakpoint
    Marker Actions</A> in the listings.</P>

    <H3><A name="set_breakpoint"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.add">Set Breakpoint</H3>

    <P>This is a dropdown of actions provided by the back-end debugger, usually for setting
    breakpoints by symbol, expression, etc. Setting breakpoints by address is typically done from
    the Listings. If no such actions are available, or there is no live target, this action is
    disabled.</P>

    <H3><A name="enable_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.enable">
    Enable</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It enables
    each selected breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is already enabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="enable_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.enable.all">
    Enable All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It enables every breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is
    already enabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="disable_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.disable">
    Disable</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It disables
    each selected breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is already disabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="disable_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src=
    "icon.debugger.breakpoint.disable.all"> Disable All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It disables every breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is
    already disabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="make_breakpoints_effective"></A><IMG alt="" src=
    "icon.debugger.breakpoint.make.effective"> Make Breakpoints Effective</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever there are mapped breakpoints with 0 locations, i.e., it
    corresponds to a target location where the breakpoint is still missing. It places such
    breakpoints where possible. This action is also offered as a resolution in the console. It
    appears in the log any time this action is available.</P>

    <H3><A name="clear_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.clear">
    Clear</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It clears
    (deletes) each selected breakpoint.</P>

    <H3><A name="clear_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.breakpoint.clear.all">
    Clear All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. <FONT color="red">Use with caution!</FONT> It deletes every
    breakpoint.</P>

    <H3><A name="set_condition"></A>Set Condition (Emulator)</H3>

    <P>This action is available when all selected locations are emulated execution breakpoints.
    (Conditional access breakpoints are not yet implemented.) It sets the condition using a Sleigh
    expression that when true will trap the emulator. When false, the emulator continues past the
    breakpoint without interruption. Sleigh operates similarly to C: zero is considered false,
    while everything else is considered true. The dialog provides syntax checking, but does not
    verify the semantics. If the breakpoint condition is not semantically correct, then the
    breakpoint behaves as if unconditional; it will interrupt the emulator then indicate the
    semantic error. To trap unconditionally (the default) use <CODE>1:1</CODE>. Otherwise, use a
    boolean Sleigh expression, such as <CODE>RAX &gt;= 0x1000</CODE>. Sleigh conditions are rather
    expressive. For example, on an x86 target, you might place a breakpoint at the entry of a
    function and set the condition to <CODE>(*:8 RSP) &amp; 0xfff00000 == 0x00400000</CODE>. This
    will break on calls to the function from any address matching <CODE>0x004?????</CODE>.</P>

    <H3><A name="set_injection"></A>Set Injection (Emulator)</H3>

    <P>This action is available when all selected locations are emulated execution breakpoints.
    (Injections on access breakpoints are not yet implemented.) It replaces the instruction's usual
    Sleigh semantics with those entered into the dialog. The Sleigh syntax is the same as used in
    the processor language's Sleigh specification (<CODE>.slaspec</CODE> and <CODE>.sinc</CODE>
    files). The dialog provides syntax checking, but does not verify the semantics. If the
    injection is not semantically correct, then the breakpoint behaves as if unconditional; it will
    interrupt the emulator then indicate the semantic error. <B>NOTE:</B> The semantics at the
    breakpoint address are <EM>completely</EM> replaced, ignoring the original instruction
    entirely. This includes its control flow behavior, even fall through. The replacement semantics
    <EM>must</EM> provide control flow behavior, or else the emulator's program counter will not
    advance, and the same injection will be executed repeatedly. Here are three ways to provide
    control flow:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Call the <CODE>emu_exec_decoded()</CODE> userop: This is probably the most common method,
      and is usually the last Sleigh statement in the injected semantics. This userop, which is
      defined by the emulator, instructs it to decode and execute the instruction at the program
      counter, effectively incorporating the original instruction's semantics. If this is not the
      last statement of the injection, please consider: If the instruction transfers control, the
      remainder of the injection is <EM>not</EM> executed. If the instruction falls through, the
      remainder of the injection <EM>is</EM> executed.</LI>

      <LI>Call the <CODE>emu_skip_decoded()</CODE> userop: This is a less common method, and is
      usually the last Sleigh statement in the injected semantics. This userop, which is defined by
      the emulator, instructs it to decode but skip the instruction at the program counter.
      (Decoding is necessary to determine the instruction's length.) Use this when the intent is to
      replace the original instruction's semantics. This will ensure the program counter advances
      without actually executing the original instruction. No matter the original instruction's
      control flow, this imposes fall through. It may be used to skip over function calls or
      jumps.</LI>

      <LI>Use a control transfer statement: This is probably the second most common method, and
      includes the Sleigh keywords <CODE>call</CODE>, <CODE>goto</CODE>, and <CODE>return</CODE>.
      Note that just as in processor specifications, a control transfer statement will be the last
      statement executed for the injection. It immediately sets the program counter, skipping the
      remainder of the injection.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Here are a few examples:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        An unconditional breakpoint. This is the default injection. The first statement calls the
        <CODE>emu_swi()</CODE> "emulator software interrupt" userop, which is defined by the
        emulator. The second statement incorporates the semantics of the original instruction: 
<PRE>
emu_swi();
emu_exec_decoded();
</PRE>
      </LI>

      <LI>
        A conditional breakpoint for <CODE>RAX &gt;= 0x1000</CODE>. This is a simple extension of
        the unconditional breakpoint. The <CODE>emu_swi()</CODE> call is skipped if the inverse of
        the condition is true: 
<PRE>
if RAX &lt; 0x1000 goto &lt;L1&gt;;
  emu_swi();
&lt;L1&gt;
emu_exec_decoded();
</PRE>
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Stub a function, returning 0. This depends on the architecture and calling convention. Take
        the AMD64 System V calling convention for example &mdash;
        <CODE>x86:LE:64:default:gcc</CODE>. The injection, located at the function's entry or in
        the program linkage table, would place the return value into the expected storage location
        then replicate the behavior of <CODE>RET</CODE>: 
<PRE>
RAX = 0;
RIP = *:8 RSP;
RSP = RSP + 8;
return [RIP];
</PRE>
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Force a <CODE>JZ</CODE> to be taken, without modifying the image. This depends on the
        architecture. Take x86 for example. The injection, located on the conditional jump, would
        simply set the flag accordingly then execute the original instruction: 
<PRE>
ZF = 1;
emu_exec_decoded();
</PRE>
        Alternatively, suppose the example instruction is <CODE>JZ 0x00401234</CODE>. Then, the
        injection can jump straight to the target: 
<PRE>
goto [0x00401234];
</PRE>
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Force a <CODE>JZ</CODE> to fall through, without modifying the image. The injection,
        located on the conditional jump, would simply skip the instruction: 
<PRE>
emu_skip_decoded();
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Filter Actions</H2>

    <P>For organizing breakpoints the manager provides the following actions:</P>

    <H3><A name="filter_by_trace"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.content.handler.trace"> Filter to
    Current Trace</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available. It filters the bottom table to those locations in the
    current trace only. Additionally, the "Locations" column of the top table will only count those
    in the current trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="filter_by_logical"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.debugger.filter"> Filter to
    Breakpoint Selection</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It filters the bottom table to those locations belonging to
    a selected breakpoint in the top table.</P>
