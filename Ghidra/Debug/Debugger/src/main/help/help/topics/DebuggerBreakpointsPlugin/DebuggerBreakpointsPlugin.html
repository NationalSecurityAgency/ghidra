    <P>Breakpoints refer to any mechanism which may trap execution based on an address. The
    breakpoints manager presents all active breakpoints among all open programs and live traces.
    Note that dead traces are not considered, and only the breakpoints at the present are
    displayed, even if the user has stepped a trace backward. Breakpoints which map to the same
    address in the same module, i.e., program image, and otherwise share the same attributes, are
    grouped into a logical breakpoint. <B>NOTE:</B> The breakpoints window cannot display or
    manipulate breakpoints from a target until that target is recorded into a trace. See the <A
    href="help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static
    Mappings</A> window for the finer details of mapping traces to imported modules. In this
    manner, breakpoints stored in Ghidra programs comprise the current breakpoint set, organized by
    address &mdash; except for breakpoints outside a known imported module. The top table of the
    provider displays logical breakpoints; the bottom table displays breakpoint locations.</P>

    <P>Depending on what is supported by the connected debugger, breakpoints can trap a target when
    an address or range is executed, read, or written; using software or hardware mechanisms. In
    case of "read" or "write," debuggers may differ in terminology, e.g., GDB might call them
    "watchpoints," but Ghidra still calls these "breakpoints." Some debuggers allow the user to
    specify a breakpoint location other than by address, but ultimately each specification is
    realized by 0 or more addressable locations. To accommodate this, the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html">Objects</A> window will
    typically display a list of specifications, each listing its locations as children. However,
    the grouping of breakpoint locations into logical breakpoints by this manager is done
    <EM>without respect</EM> to the specifications. Often the specification is at a higher stratum
    than Ghidra natively understands, e.g., the source filename and line number, and so such
    specifications are not relevant. Note, however, that the model might not permit locations to be
    manipulated independently of their specification, which may limit how the manager can operate
    on each breakpoint location.</P>

    <P>Because of the logical grouping of breakpoints, it is possible for a breakpoint to be in a
    mixed or inconsistent state. This happens quite commonly, e.g., when a breakpoint is placed in
    a Ghidra program before that program is mapped in any traced target. Once mapped in, the
    location of that breakpoint in the trace is computed and noted as missing. A logical breakpoint
    without any location in a trace (i.e., on an actual target) is called "ineffective" and is
    drawn in grey. An enabled logical breakpoint having a disabled location is called
    "inconsistent" and its icon will indicate that state. A disabled logical breakpoint having an
    enabled location is similarly "inconsistent." Toggling ineffective or inconsistent breakpoints
    enables and/or places all locations, bringing it into a consistent enabled state. Toggling it
    again disables all locations.</P>

    <H2>Tables and Columns</H2>

    <P>The top table, which lists logical breakpoints, has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Enabled - displays an icon indicating the state of the breakpoint. Clicking the icon
      toggles the breakpoint.</LI>

      <UL style="list-style-type: none">
        <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-enable.png"> Enabled</LI>

        <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-disable.png"> Disabled</LI>

        <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-mixed-ed.png"> Inconsistent: Enabled with disabled
        locations</LI>

        <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-mixed-de.png"> Inconsistent: Disabled with enabled
        locations</LI>

        <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-ineffective-e.png"> Enabled but ineffective</LI>

        <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-ineffective-d.png"> Disabled and ineffective</LI>
      </UL>

      <LI>Image - gives the name of the Ghidra program, if the breakpoint is mapped to one.</LI>

      <LI>Address - gives the address of the breakpoint. For a breakpoint mapped to a Ghidra
      program, this gives the address in that program. For a breakpoint not mapped, this gives the
      address in its trace.</LI>

      <LI>Length - usually 1. For access breakpoints, this notes the length in bytes of the address
      range.</LI>

      <LI>Kinds - indicates the kind(s) of breakpoint: SW_EXECUTE, HW_EXECUTE, READ, and/or
      WRITE.</LI>

      <LI>Locations - counts the number of trace locations mapped to this logical breakpoint,
      applying the trace filter if active. Note that a logical breakpoint with 0 locations is
      ineffective.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The bottom table, which lists trace breakpoint locations, has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Enabled - displays an icon indicating the state of the location. Clicking the icon
      toggles the location.</LI>

      <LI>Name - displays the name given to the location by the connected debugger. This field is
      user modifiable.</LI>

      <LI>Address - gives the address of this location in its trace.</LI>

      <LI>Trace - gives the name of the location's trace &mdash; the target path by default.</LI>

      <LI>Threads - if the breakpoint applies to a limited set of threads, gives the list of
      threads.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - gives a user comment &mdash; the specification expression by default. This
      field is user modifiable.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Breakpoint Actions</H2>

    <P>The primary purpose of this provider is to manipulate existing breakpoints. It provides the
    following actions to that end. Breakpoints can also be managed via the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Breakpoint
    Marker Actions</A> in the disassembly listings.</P>

    <H3><A name="enable_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-enable.png"> Enable
    Selected Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It enables
    each selected breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is already enabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="enable_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoints-enable-all.png">
    Enable All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It enables every breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is
    already enabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="disable_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-disable.png"> Disable
    Selected Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It disables
    each selected breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is already disabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="disable_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoints-disable-all.png">
    Disable All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It disables every breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is
    already disabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="make_breakpoints_effective"></A><IMG alt="" src=
    "images/breakpoints-make-effective.png"> Make Breakpoints Effective</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever there are mapped breakpoints with 0 locations, i.e., it
    corresponds to a target location where the breakpoint is still missing. It places such
    breakpoints where possible. This action is also offered as a resolution in the console. It
    appears in the log any time this action is available.</P>

    <H3><A name="clear_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-clear.png"> Clear
    Selected Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It clears
    (deletes) each selected breakpoint.</P>

    <H3><A name="clear_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoints-clear-all.png">
    Clear All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. <FONT color="red">Use with caution!</FONT> It deletes every
    breakpoint.</P>

    <H2>Filter Actions</H2>

    <P>For organizing breakpoints the manager provides the following actions:</P>

    <H3><A name="filter_by_trace"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/video-x-generic16.png"> Filter to
    Current Trace</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available. It filters the bottom table to those locations in the
    current trace only. Additionally, the "Locations" column of the top table will only count those
    in the current trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="filter_by_logical"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/filter_off.png"> Filter to
    Breakpoint Selection</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It filters the bottom table to those locations belonging to
    a selected breakpoint in the top table.</P>
