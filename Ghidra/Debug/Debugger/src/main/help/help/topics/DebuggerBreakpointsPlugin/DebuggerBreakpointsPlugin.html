    </TABLE>

    <P>The breakpoints window tabulates and manipulates breakpoints among all live and traced
    targets. Only address-based breakpoints are tabulated. For other traps, e.g., "break on
    exception," see the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html">Objects Window</A>. Breakpoints
    can also be manipulated from address-based views, especially the disassembly listings. See <A
    href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Breakpoints in
    the Listings</A>. Display of breakpoints in other views, e.g., the decompiler, is not yet
    implemented.</P>

    <P>Individual breakpoint locations from among the targets are consolidated into logical
    breakpoints, based on their addresses in the static listing. The static locations are typically
    stored as bookmarks in their respective Ghidra programs, comprising the current breakpoint set.
    See the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin/DebuggerStaticMappingPlugin.html">Static Mappings</A>
    window for the finer details of address mapping. A breakpoint which cannot be mapped to a
    static address becomes its own logical breakpoint at its dynamic address. The top table of the
    provider displays logical breakpoints; the bottom table displays breakpoint locations.
    <B>NOTE:</B> The breakpoints window cannot display or manipulate breakpoints from a target
    until that target is recorded into a trace. Furthermore, dead traces are not included. Nor are
    breakpoints from the past included, even when viewing past machine state.</P>

    <P>Depending on what is supported by the connected debugger, breakpoints can trap a target when
    an address or range is executed, read, or written; using software or hardware mechanisms. In
    case of "read" or "write," debuggers may differ in terminology, e.g., GDB might call them
    "watchpoints," but Ghidra still calls these "breakpoints." Some debuggers allow the user to
    specify a breakpoint location other than by address, but ultimately each specification is
    realized by 0 or more addressable locations. To accommodate this, the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html">Objects</A> window will
    typically display a list of specifications, each listing its locations as children. However,
    the grouping of breakpoint locations into logical breakpoints by this manager is done
    <EM>without respect</EM> to the specifications. Often the specification is at a higher stratum
    than Ghidra natively understands, e.g., the source filename and line number, and so such
    specifications are not relevant. Note, however, that the model might not permit locations to be
    manipulated independently of their specification, which may limit how the manager can operate
    on each breakpoint location.</P>

    <P>Because of the logical grouping of breakpoints, it is possible for a breakpoint to be in a
    mixed or inconsistent state. This happens quite commonly, e.g., when a breakpoint is placed in
    a Ghidra program before that program is mapped in any traced target. Once mapped in, the
    location of that breakpoint in the trace is computed and noted as missing. A logical breakpoint
    without any location in a trace (i.e., on an actual target) is called <EM>ineffective</EM> and
    is drawn in grey, e.g.: <IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-enable-ineff.png">. An enabled
    logical breakpoint having a disabled location is called <EM>inconsistent</EM> and its icon will
    include an exclamation mark: <IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-overlay-inconsistent.png">. A
    disabled logical breakpoint having an enabled location is similarly inconsistent. Toggling an
    ineffective or inconsistent logical breakpoint enables and/or places all its locations, aiming
    for a consistent enabled state. Toggling it again disables all locations.</P>

    <H2>Tables and Columns</H2>

    <P>The top table, which lists logical breakpoints, has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>State - displays an icon indicating the state of the breakpoint. If rendered in grey, the
      breakpoint has no locations, i.e., it is ineffective. If rendered with an exclamation mark
      overlay, the breakpoint is inconsistent. Clicking the icon toggles the breakpoint.</LI>

        <UL style="list-style-type: none">
          <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-enable.png"> Enabled: The logical breakpoint,
          including all its locations, is enabled.</LI>

          <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-disable.png"> Disabled: The logical breakpoint,
          including all its locations, is disabled.</LI>

          <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-mixed.png"> Mixed: (Listing only) Two logical
          breakpoints at the same address have different states.</LI>
        </UL>

      <LI>Name - gives the user-defined name of the breakpoint. This cell is only populated and
      modifiable when the breakpoint is bookmarked in a program, since the name is associated with
      the static location.</LI>

      <LI>Address - gives the address of the breakpoint. This is typically the static address. If
      the breakpoint cannot be mapped to a static address, this is its dynamic address.</LI>

      <LI>Image - gives the name of the static image, i.e., Ghidra program. If the breakpoint
      cannot be mapped to a static location, this is blank.</LI>

      <LI>Length - usually 1. For access breakpoints, this is the length of the address range (in
      bytes).</LI>

      <LI>Kinds - indicates the kind(s) of breakpoint: SW_EXECUTE, HW_EXECUTE, READ, and/or
      WRITE.</LI>

      <LI>Locations - counts the number of locations included in this logical breakpoint, applying
      the trace filter if active. Note that a logical breakpoint with 0 locations is
      ineffective.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The bottom table, which lists breakpoint locations, has the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>State - displays an icon indicating the state of the location. If rendered with an
      exclamation mark overlay, the location does not agree with its logical breakpoint, or it
      cannot be bookmarked. Clicking the icon toggles the location.</LI>

        <UL style="list-style-type: none">
          <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-enable.png"> Enabled: The location is
          enabled.</LI>

          <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-disable.png"> Disabled: The location is
          disabled.</LI>

          <LI><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-mixed.png"> Mixed: (Listing only) Two locations at
          the same address have different states.</LI>
        </UL>

      <LI>Name - displays the name given to the location by the connected debugger. This field is
      user modifiable.</LI>

      <LI>Address - gives the dynamic address of this location.</LI>

      <LI>Trace - gives the name of the location's trace.</LI>

      <LI>Threads - (hidden by default) if the breakpoint applies to a limited set of threads,
      gives the list of threads.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - gives a user comment &mdash; the specification's expression by default. This
      field is user modifiable.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Breakpoint Actions</H2>

    <P>The primary purpose of this provider is to manipulate existing breakpoints. It provides the
    following actions to that end. Breakpoints can also be managed via the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Breakpoint
    Marker Actions</A> in the listings.</P>

    <H3><A name="enable_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-enable.png">
    Enable</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It enables
    each selected breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is already enabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="enable_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoints-enable-all.png">
    Enable All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It enables every breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is
    already enabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="disable_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-disable.png">
    Disable</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It disables
    each selected breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is already disabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="disable_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoints-disable-all.png">
    Disable All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It disables every breakpoint. For any breakpoint that is
    already disabled, no action is taken.</P>

    <H3><A name="make_breakpoints_effective"></A><IMG alt="" src=
    "images/breakpoints-make-effective.png"> Make Breakpoints Effective</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever there are mapped breakpoints with 0 locations, i.e., it
    corresponds to a target location where the breakpoint is still missing. It places such
    breakpoints where possible. This action is also offered as a resolution in the console. It
    appears in the log any time this action is available.</P>

    <H3><A name="clear_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-clear.png"> Clear</H3>

    <P>This action is available when one or more breakpoints or locations are selected. It clears
    (deletes) each selected breakpoint.</P>

    <H3><A name="clear_all_breakpoints"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoints-clear-all.png">
    Clear All Breakpoints</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. <FONT color="red">Use with caution!</FONT> It deletes every
    breakpoint.</P>

    <H2>Filter Actions</H2>

    <P>For organizing breakpoints the manager provides the following actions:</P>

    <H3><A name="filter_by_trace"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/video-x-generic16.png"> Filter to
    Current Trace</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available. It filters the bottom table to those locations in the
    current trace only. Additionally, the "Locations" column of the top table will only count those
    in the current trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="filter_by_logical"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/filter_off.png"> Filter to
    Breakpoint Selection</H3>

    <P>This action is always available. It filters the bottom table to those locations belonging to
    a selected breakpoint in the top table.</P>
