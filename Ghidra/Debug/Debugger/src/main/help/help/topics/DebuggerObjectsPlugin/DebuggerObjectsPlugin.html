    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Commands and Objects</H1>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center"><IMG alt="" border="1" src="images/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The Objects window permits the user to interact directly with a connected debugger and its
    targets. Along with the command-line interpreter, it is the primary mechanism for issuing
    commands, e.g., <B>step</B>, to a target. Commands are accessible from the tool bar, the
    pull-down, and pop-up menus. Commands are enabled in two ways: (1) the object selected has a
    property that marks it as a logical target for that command, or (2) the object has an ancestor
    for which the command makes sense. The <A href=
    "DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#act_on_selection_only">Enable By Selection Only</A> function
    determines whether both options are in play. For example, threads and inferiors/processes are
    both <B>resumable</B>, so the <A href="DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#resume">Resume</A> action
    works on both. For many of our targets, processes are <B>interruptible</B> while threads are
    not. Nevertheless, if <B>Enable By Selection Only</B> is off, you can interrupt a thread
    because it descends from an inferior or process. In almost every case, the selection directly
    or indirectly determines the set of valid or enabled actions.</P>

    <P>The application of these special properties to each object to determine its behavior and
    relevant actions allows all objects to be treated generically. This feature has several
    powerful implications. All objects may be represented in many ways, and one representation may
    easily be converted into another. The default representation is a tree, and the Objects plugin
    starts with a tree to represent a debugger session's state. Any portion of the tree may be
    reproduced as its own subtree or as a table or as a graph using the <A href=
    "DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#display_as">Display as...</A> actions. Any portion of the display
    may be exported from or imported into the plugin. The generic aspect of all objects also allows
    the user to process them in scripts or plugins in common ways. For example, you could write a
    script to walk the entire tree and find objects with "File" in the name or with the value
    0xDEADBEEF.</P>

    <P>The hierarchy reflected in the initial display has either been derived from the target, as
    is the case with WinDbg Preview's dbgmodel.dll engine, or imposed by the designers of the
    current connector's "model." The model has a type schema chosen by the authors for a particular
    debugger target. It usually mirrors to some extent the underlying relationships in the native
    debugger, but need not, and is usually fixed for that target. Commands executed within this
    plugin are passed from the GUI through the model, typically manifesting in native API calls, or
    commands sent to a special interpreter of the debugger. This plugin does not operate on traces,
    except for actions which initiate a recording.</P>

    <H2>Actions for Target Management</H2>

    <H3><A name="quick_launch"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/debugger.png"> Quick Launch</H3>

    <P>Launches a new target using the current program. This action is the fastest and probably
    most common way of starting a debugger target on an existing connection. The action attempts to
    launch the program in the currently selected tab of the static listing window. The success of
    the action depends on the program being associated with an existing executable file on the
    local system. The value associated with the program may, of course, be checked using the <A
    href="help/topics/About/About_Program_File.htm">About Program File</A> function.</P>

    <H3><A name="launch"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/launch.png"> Launch</H3>

    <P>Launch a new target. Sometimes you may wish to launch a program which has not been imported,
    to launch a program with various configuration options, or to pass arguments to the program.
    The launch dialog allows you to do this. Typically, the dialog will present a single empty box
    into which you can enter the command with arguments as you would on a command line. For some
    targets, the dialog will present pre-configured options corresponding to common launch modes
    for the platform.</P>

    <P>For example, the CommandLineLaunch version of the dialog for JDI targets displays a check
    box for whether the target should be suspended on launch, the default quote character used by
    the command line, the program used to start the virtual machine (java), the path to where it's
    installed, and fields for the name of the class and any user options you might supply:</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center"><IMG alt="" border="1" src=
          "images/DebuggerMethodInvocationDialog_ForLaunch.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The options displayed by the Launch command are, for some targets, connected to the
    currently selected item under Connectors. For example, the dbgmodel.dll connector offers
    several launchers: one for command-line launch, one for attach, open for kernel-mode debugging,
    and one for opening previously-generated dump or TTD trace files.</P>

    <H3><A name="attach"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/attach.png"> Attach</H3>

    <P>Attach to a running target. If the debugger has available a list of running targets for the
    local system, the attach action provides a convenient way to select and attach to an existing
    process. If the highlighted object in the provider is considered "attachable", the attach
    action attempts to connect that element. The list of "attachable" targets is typically
    displayed in the tree under <B>Session/Available</B>. Bear in mind it often takes time to
    populate the <B>Available</B> list, which may need to be manually refreshed.</P>

    <H3><A name="detach"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/detach.png"> Detach</H3>

    <P>Detach from the selected target, usually allowing it to resume execution. As a consequence,
    this action terminates the trace for the current target, if applicable.</P>

    <H3><A name="re-attach"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/attach.png"> Re-attach</H3>

    <P>Re-attaches to the selected target. (Some targets require a separate action for re-attaching
    vs. attaching for the first time. If so, this action provides that capability.)</P>

    <H3><A name="kill"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/kill.png"> Kill</H3>

    <P>Kill the current target. As a consequence, this action terminates the trace for the current
    target, if applicable.</P>

    <H2>Actions for Execution Management</H2>

    <H3><A name="interrupt"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stop.png"> Interrupt (Pause, Suspend,
    Break)</H3>

    <P>Interrupt the current target's execution.</P>

    <H3><A name="resume"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/continue.png"> Resume (Continue, Go)</H3>

    <P>Allow the current target to resume execution.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_into"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepinto.png"> Step Into</H3>

    <P>Step the current target to the next instruction.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_over"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepover.png"> Step Over</H3>

    <P>Step the current target to the next instruction in the current subroutine.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_finish"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepout.png"> Finish</H3>

    <P>Allow the current target to finish the current subroutine, pausing after.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_last"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepout.png"> Step Last / Extended</H3>

    <P>Perform a target-defined step, often the last (possibly custom or extended) step.</P>

    <H3><A name="set_breakpoint"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/breakpoint-set.png"> Set
    Breakpoint</H3>

    <P>Set a breakpoint, which will trap target execution under certain conditions.</P>

    <TABLE width="100%">
      <TBODY>
        <TR>
          <TD align="center"><IMG alt="" border="1" src="images/DebuggerBreakpointDialog.png"></TD>
        </TR>
      </TBODY>
    </TABLE>

    <P>The given expression can follow any form accepted by the connected debugger, although most
    often this will be an address. Compare this to the listing, which can only set breakpoints on
    specific addresses, not symbols or expressions. Furthermore, some targets allow breakpoints to
    be specified before a target is launched. Conversely, the listing is not available until the
    target is launched and being recorded. For a recorded target, breakpoints (including locations
    set via this action) can be managed in the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointsPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointsPlugin.html">Breakpoints</A> window
    or using the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin/DebuggerBreakpointMarkerPlugin.html">Breakpoint
    Marker</A> actions from the disassembly listings.</P>

    <H2>Actions for Trace Management</H2>

    <P>The following actions manage target tracing. Note that many other windows are not usable
    until a target is recorded into a trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="record"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/record.png"> Record</H3>

    <P>Record the current target, if its platform is recognized, and open its trace. If Ghidra
    cannot uniquely identify the platform, it may prompt the user to select from a list of
    possibilities.</P>

    <H3><A name="record_automatically"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/record.png"> Record
    Automatically</H3>

    <P>Automatically record and open recognized targets. If Ghidra cannot uniquely identify the
    platform, it will select one by priority without prompting the user.</P>

    <H2><A name="display_as"></A>Actions for Display Management</H2>

    <P>The following actions can create additional displays of portions of the debugger model.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_as_tree"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_as_tree.png"> Display As
    Tree</H3>

    <P>Constructs a new tree using the selection as the new root, synchronized with the current
    provider.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_as_table"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_as_table.png"> Display As
    Table</H3>

    <P>Constructs a table from the current object, synchronized with the current provider. If the
    object is a container, its elements will be rows in the new table and their attributes will be
    columns. If not, the attributes will be rows and their name, kind, value, and type will be
    columns.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_as_graph"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_as_graph.png"> Display As
    Graph</H3>

    <P>Constructs and displays a graph from the selection and its visible descendants. NOTE: The
    graph does not currently maintain synchronization.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_as_xml"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_as_xml.png"> Display As
    XML</H3>

    <P>Encodes the selected object and its visible descendants in XML and prints the result to the
    console. NOTE: Various characters not allowed in XML may be converted, typically to
    underscores, in the result.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_filtered_tree"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_filtered_tree.png">
    Display Filtered Tree</H3>

    <P>Constructs a static snapshot of the selection and its visible descendants as a tree,
    applying a filter to the selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_filtered_table"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_filtered_table.png">
    Display Filtered Table</H3>

    <P>Constructs a static snapshot of the selection and its visible descendants as a table,
    applying a filter to the selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_filtered_graph"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_filtered_graph.png">
    Display Filtered Graph</H3>

    <P>Constructs a static snapshot of the selection and its visible descendants as a graph,
    applying a filter to the selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_filtered_xml"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/display_filtered_xml.png">
    Display Filtered XML</H3>

    <P>Constructs a static snapshot of the selection and its visible descendants as XML, applying a
    filter to the selection.</P>

    <H3><A name="display_methods"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/blank.png"> Display Methods</H3>

    <P>Displays a list of the methods available for the selection, which may be applied and
    combined in a filter.</P>

    <H2>Actions for Data Management</H2>

    <H3><A name="export_as_xml"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/export_as_xml.png"> Export as XML</H3>

    <P>Converts the selection and its visible descendants to XML and exports the result to a file
    of the user's choosing.</P>

    <H3><A name="import_from_xml"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/import_from_xml.png"> Import from
    XML</H3>

    <P>Imports "facts" from a file of the user's choosing and renders it as a tree.</P>

    <H3><A name="export_as_facts"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/export_as_facts.png"> Export as
    Facts</H3>

    <P>Converts the selection and its visible descendants to "fact" files and exports the result to
    a directory of the user's choosing. Currently, "fact" files itemize the path, name, value,
    type, and children for each object.</P>

    <H3><A name="import_from_facts"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/import_from_facts.png"> Import from
    Facts</H3>

    <P>Imports XML from a directory of the user's choosing and renders them as a tree.</P>

    <H3><A name="open_trace"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/text-xml.png"> Import from trace</H3>

    <P>Import from trace is roughly equivalent to using the open dump/trace connector.</P>

    <H2>Miscellaneous Actions</H2>

    <H3><A name="console"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/console.png"> Console</H3>

    <P>Shows the console for the selected context, usually the debugger's command-line interpreter.
    Some models may also present a target's standard I/O via a console.</P>

    <H3><A name="refresh"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/reload.png"> Refresh Node</H3>

    <P>Queries the model for the current object's children and rebuilds that portion of the
    display.</P>

    <H3><A name="toggle_base">Toggle Base</A></H3>

    <P>Asks the connector to display numeric values in decimal or hexadecimal. This may also cause
    updates to the trace database, renaming objects whose names are derived from those numeric
    values.</P>

    <H3><A name="toggle_subscription">Subscribe / Unsubscribe to Selection</A></H3>

    <P>Asks the recorder to include or exclude the current object from the trace.</P>

    <H3><A name="act_on_selection_only"></A>Enable By Selection Only</H3>

    <P>Toggles the scope of the other action menus. If "selection only" is chosen, the current
    object must have the property used to enable the particular action. For instance, the
    <B>step</B> action will only be enabled for objects marked <B>steppable</B>. If "selection
    only" is off, the debugger will walk the path up from the current object looking for an
    ancestor for which the action is enabled. For example, if threads are <B>steppable</B> and
    contain registers as descendants, <B>step</B> will still be enabled for that thread if the
    current selection is one of its registers.</P>

    <H3><A name="hide_intrinsic_attributes"></A>Hide Intrinsic Attributes</H3>

    <P>Toggle whether hidden objects are visible &mdash; mostly for diagnostic purposes. Some
    attributes convey information intended for the user and some convey information for the
    machine. The latter are not normally visible, because they just clutter the display. However,
    under certain circumstances, the user may want to see them. For example, the <B>_state</B>
    attribute indicates whether a thread is running or stopped. In the latter case, this
    information is reflected for the user by visual cues in the display, but the invisible
    attribute actually determines the behavior.</P>

    <H3><A name="toggle_ignore_state">Ignore State</A></H3>

    <P>Many actions are normally allowed only if the target is stopped or in some other defined
    state. Sometimes you may wish to ignore the current state and force the action, as, for
    example, when the debugger has lost track of the true state.</P>

    <H2><A name="color"></A>Color Options</H2>

    <P>The debugger represents different types of objects with different colors. Bear in mind these
    colors are not blended, i.e. one color may override another. Examples include:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Default: normal objects</LI>

      <LI>Modified: objects recently changed</LI>

      <LI>Links: objects from a different portion of the display</LI>

      <LI>Intrinsics: objects with a value, such as strings or numbers</LI>

      <LI>Invisible: objects used internally by the provider</LI>

      <LI>Accessors: objects which may used to supply other objects (before they've been
      populated)</LI>

      <LI>Targets: native objects with special properties</LI>
    </UL>
