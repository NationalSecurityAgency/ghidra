    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Time Overview</H1>

    <P>Patterned on the Program Overview, this plugin provides a pair of sidebars for the Dynamic
    Listing that indicate the history of the current trace, similar to those in the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html">Time</A> and <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerMemviewPlugin/DebuggerMemviewPlugin.html">Memview</A> plugins. The Trace
    Overview bar gives a compressed view of various events (thread creation/destruction, module
    loads/unloads, et cetera). Events are added in time snap order <EM>without</EM> spaces between
    consecutive events, as in the Memview display. The Trace Selection sidebar allows the user to
    click &amp; drag over a section of either sidebar and zooms in on that time span. In the zoomed
    version, events are in snap order <EM>with</EM> intervening space to indicate the actual time
    delays (although these are dictated, in part, by the numbering schema for events).</P>

    <H2>Navigation</H2>

    <H3><A name="zoom"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.widget.imagepanel.zoom.in">Zoom</H3>

    <P>Clicking and dragging over a region of the Trace Overview causes that span to be displayed
    uncompressed in the Trace Selection. The same action can also be applied to the Trace Selection
    itself, resulting in a more detailed zoom.</P>

    <H3><A name="move"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.widget.imagepanel.zoom.in">Move</H3>

    <P>Shift click &amp; drag on the Trace Selection allows the user to move forward and backward
    in the view without rescaling.</P>
