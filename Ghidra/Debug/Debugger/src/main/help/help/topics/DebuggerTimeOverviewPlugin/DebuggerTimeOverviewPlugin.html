    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Time Overview</H1>

    <P>Patterned on the Program Overview, this plugin provides a pair of sidebars for the 
	Dynamic Listing that indicate the history of the current trace, similar to those in the 
	<A href="help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html">Time</A>
	and <A href="help/topics/DebuggerMemviewPlugin/DebuggerMemviewPlugin.html">Memview</A> plugins.  
	The Trace Overview bar gives a compressed view of various events
	(thread creation/destruction, module loads/unloads, et cetera). Events are added in time
	snap order <em>without</em> spaces between consecutive events, as in the Memview display. The Trace 
	Selection sidebar allows the user to click &amp; drag over a section of either sidebar and zooms 
	in on that time span. In the zoomed version, events are in snap order <em>with</em> intervening space
	to indicate the actual time delays (although these are dictated, in part, by the numbering
	schema for events).
	</P>

    <H3><A name="zoom"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.widget.imagepanel.zoom.in">Zoom</H3>

    <P>Clicking and dragging over a region of the Trace Overview causes that
	span to be displayed uncompressed in the Trace Selection. The same action can also
	be applied to the Trace Selection itself, resulting in a more detailed zoom.</P>
	
	<H3><A name="move"></A><IMG alt="" src="icon.widget.imagepanel.zoom.in">Move</H3>
	
	<P>Shift click &amp; drag on the Trace Selection allows the user to move forward and
	backward in the view without rescaling.
