    <P>In general, a thread refers to a unit of concurrent execution within a target. Typically,
    each thread carries its own execution context, so this window provides a means of navigating
    those contexts. Furthermore, this window provides a means of navigating and managing open
    traces, much like the static listing provides a means of navigating open programs. The window
    also plots a timeline showing thread lifespans, and displays a caret which can be used to
    navigate the current point in time. This window, the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStackPlugin/DebuggerStackPlugin.html">Stack</A> window, and the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html">Dynamic Listing</A> window
    provide a complete trace navigation system.</P>

    <H2>Trace Tabs</H2>

    <P>The trace tab bar is displayed when at least one trace is open. It displays the name of each
    open trace in a button, where the "current" or "focused" trace is selected. Clicking a tab will
    select its trace and focus the tool onto it. A trace associated with a live target has a red
    "recording" icon at its left. If that icon is not present, or has disappeared, the trace is
    dead or terminated. A "dead" trace can still be manipulated and marked up, but it will not
    record any new target information.</P>

    <H3><A name="close_trace"></A><A name="close_all_traces"></A><A name=
    "close_other_traces"></A><A name="close_dead_traces"></A>Close Trace / All / Other / Dead
    Traces</H3>

    <P>In most cases, a trace is ephemeral, but occasionally, interesting behavior is observed that
    is difficult to store as static mark-up. When traces are no longer needed, they can be closed
    by right-clicking a tab and selecting one of the actions. See <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTraceManagerServicePlugin/DebuggerTraceManagerServicePlugin.html#close_trace">Trace
    Management</A> for details of each action.</P>

    <H2>Navigating Threads</H2>

    <P>Selecting a thread in the table will navigate to (or "activate" or "focus") that thread.
    Windows which are sensitive to the current thread will update. Notably, the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerRegistersPlugin/DebuggerRegistersPlugin.html">Registers</A> window will
    display the activated thread's register values. <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html">Listing</A> windows with
    configured location tracking will re-compute that location with the thread's context and
    navigate to it. The thread timeline plots all recorded threads. Threads which are alive will
    appear to extend "to the end of time." The threads table displays more detailed information in
    the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Name - the name of the thread given by the debugger. Often, this is just an index or
      unique id assigned to the thread. This field can be modified, but it has no effect on the
      target.</LI>

      <LI>Created - the snapshot when this thread was first observed. If the thread's creation was
      observed, then it is its creation time.</LI>

      <LI>Destroyed - if destroyed, the snapshot when this thread was last observed. If the
      thread's destruction was observed, then it is its destruction time.</LI>

      <LI>State - the thread's current state. For a dead trace, this is either ALIVE or TERMINATED,
      and depends solely on whether or not a destruction time was recorded. For a live trace, this
      may also take RUNNING, STOPPED, or UNKNOWN, depending on what is reported by the debugger.
      The state always reflects the present, or latest known, state.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - a user-modifiable comment about the thread.</LI>

      <LI>Plot - a graphical representation of the thread's lifespan. Unlike other column headers,
      clicking and dragging in this one will navigate through time. To rearrange this column, hold
      SHIFT while dragging.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Navigating Time</H2>

    <P>The user can navigate through time within the current trace by using the caret in the plot
    column header. There are also actions for "stepping the trace" forward and backward. See the <A
    href="help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html">Time</A> window for a way to
    display and navigate to specific events in the trace's timeline. Note that stepping away from
    the present will prevent most windows from interacting with the live target. While some
    components and scripts may interact with the target and record things "into the present," such
    updates may not appear on screen until the user steps back to the present. Stepping the trace
    does not affect the target, except that viewing the present requires querying the live target,
    which can perturb its state.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_snap_backward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow_up.png">Step Trace
    Snap Backward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there exists a snapshot previous to the current. It steps the
    trace backward to the previous snapshot, causing most windows to display the recorded data from
    the new point in time.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_snap_forward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow_down.png">Step Trace
    Snap Forward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there exists a snapshot ahead of the current. It steps the
    trace forward to the next snapshot, causing most windows to display the recorded data from the
    new point in time.</P>

    <H3><A name="emu_trace_tick_backward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepback.png">Emulate Trace
    Tick Backward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the current point in time includes emulated steps. It steps
    the trace backward to the previous tick.</P>

    <H3><A name="emu_trace_tick_forward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepinto.png">Emulate Trace
    Tick Forward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a thread is selected. It steps the current thread forward to
    the next tick, using emulation. Note that emulation does not affect the target. Furthermore,
    emulation may halt early if it encounters certain instructions or causes an exception.</P>

    <H3><A name="emu_trace_skip_tick_forward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/skipover.png">Emulate
    Trace Skip Tick Forward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a thread is selected. It steps the current thread forward by
    skipping the next instruction, using emulation. Note that emulation does not affect the target.
    Furthermore, emulation may halt early if it encounters certain instructions or causes an
    exception. This action may be used skip subroutines; <B>however</B>, the stack may require
    additional patching, e.g., to clean up stack parameters, depending on the calling convention.
    This action <EM>does not</EM> perform those patches automatically. It only advances the program
    counter. You may use <A href="#goto_time">Go To Time</A> to append the require stack patch,
    e.g., <CODE>t0-{RSP=RSP+8}</CODE>.</P>

    <H3><A name="seek_trace_present"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/seek-present.png">Seek Trace to
    Present</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available and is enabled by default. When first enabled, if the
    current trace is live, it immediately steps the trace to the present. Furthermore, as long as
    it is enabled and the current trace is live, whenever the recorder steps forward, the tool
    steps with it. In most cases, this option should remain on, otherwise stepping the target will
    not cause any windows to update. Toggling it off then on is a quick way to return to the
    present after browsing the past.</P>

    <H3><A name="goto_time"></A>Go To Time</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a trace is active. It prompts for a <B>Time Schedule</B>
    expression. This is the same form as the expression in the title bar of the threads window. In
    many cases, it is simply the snapshot number, e.g., <CODE>3</CODE>, which will go to the
    snapshot with key 3. It may optionally include an emulation schedule, for example,
    <CODE>3:10</CODE> will use snapshot 3 for an emulator's initial state and step 10 machine
    instructions on snapshot 3's event thread. If the snapshot does not give an event thread, then
    the thread must be specified in the expression, e.g., <CODE>3:t1-10</CODE>. That expression
    will start at snapshot 3, get the thread with key 1, and step it 10 machine instructions. The
    stepping commands can be repeated any number of times, separated by semicolons, to step threads
    in a specified sequence, e.g., <CODE>3:t1-10;t2-5</CODE> will do the same as before, then get
    thread 2 and step it 5 times.</P>

    <P>The emulator's state can also be modified by the schedule. Instead of specifying a number of
    steps, write a <B>Sleigh</B> statement, e.g., <CODE>3:t1-{r0=0x1234};10</CODE>. This will start
    at snapshot 3, patch thread 1's r0 to 0x1234, then step 10 instructions. Like stepping
    commands, the thread may be omitted for Sleigh commands. Each command without a thread
    specified implicitly uses the one from the previous command, or in the case of the first
    command, the event thread. Only one Sleigh statement is permitted per command.</P>

    <P>A second command sequence may be appended, following a dot, to command the emulator at the
    level of p-code operations as well. This is particularly useful when debugging a processor
    specification. See also the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerPcodeStepperPlugin/DebuggerPcodeStepperPlugin.html">P-code Stepper</A>
    window. For example, <CODE>3:2.10</CODE> will start at snapshot 3 and step the event thread 2
    machine instructions, followed by 10 p-code operations. The same thread-by-thread sequencing
    and state patching commands are allowed in the p-code command sequence. The <EM>entire</EM>
    instruction sequence precedes the entire p-code sequence, i.e., only a single dot is allowed.
    Once the expression enters p-code mode, it cannot re-enter instruction mode.</P>

    <H2>Other Actions</H2>

    <H3><A name="sync_focus"></A>Synchronize Trace and Target Focus</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available and is enabled by default. While enabled, any changes in
    navigation coordinates are translated, to the extent possible, and sent to the connected
    debugger. This may, for example, issue <CODE>thread</CODE> and/or <CODE>frame</CODE> commands
    to GDB so that commands typed into its CLI will refer to the same thread and frame as is
    focused in Ghidra. Conversely, any debugger events which indicate a change in focus are
    translated, to the extent possible, into navigation coordinates and activated in Ghidra. For
    example, if the user issues a <CODE>frame</CODE> command to the CLI of a GDB connection, then
    Ghidra will navigate to that same frame.</P>
