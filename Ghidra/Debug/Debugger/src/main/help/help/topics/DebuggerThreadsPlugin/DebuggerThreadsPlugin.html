    <P>In general, a thread refers to a unit of concurrent execution within a target. Typically,
    each thread carries its own execution context, so this window provides a means of navigating
    those contexts. Furthermore, this window provides a means of navigating and managing open
    traces, much like the static listing provides a means of navigating open programs. The window
    also provides a timeline showing thread lifespans, and displays a caret which can be used to
    navigate the current point in time. This window, the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerStackPlugin/DebuggerStackPlugin.html">Stack</A> window, and the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html">Dynamic Listing</A> window
    provide a complete trace navigation system.</P>

    <H2>Trace Tabs</H2>

    <P>The trace tab bar is displayed when at least one trace is open. It displays the name of each
    open trace in a button, where the "current" or "focused" trace is selected. Clicking a tab will
    select its trace and focus the tool onto it. A trace associated with a live target has a red
    "recording" icon at its left. If that icon is not present, or has disappeared, the trace is
    dead or terminated. A "dead" trace can still be manipulated and marked up, but it will not
    record any new target information.</P>

    <P>In most cases, a trace is ephemeral, but occasionally, interesting behavior is observed that
    is difficult to store as static mark-up. When a trace is no longer needed, it can be closed by
    right-clicking the tab and selecting "Close Trace." <FONT color="red">Warning:</FONT> closing a
    trace that has not been saved <EM>cannot</EM> be undone. If you accumulate many unwanted
    traces, use one of the "Close Others," "Close Dead," or "Close All" actions from the pop-up
    menu.</P>

    <H2>Navigating Threads</H2>

    <P>Selecting a thread in the timeline or the table will navigate to (or "activate" or "focus")
    that thread. Windows which are sensitive to the current thread will update. Notably, the <A
    href="help/topics/DebuggerRegistersPlugin/DebuggerRegistersPlugin.html">Registers</A> window
    will display the activated thread's register values. <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerListingPlugin/DebuggerListingPlugin.html">Listing</A> windows with
    configured location tracking will re-compute that location with the thread's context and
    navigate to it. The thread timeline displays all recorded threads. Threads which are alive will
    appear to extend "to the end of time." The threads table displays more detailed information in
    the following columns:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Name - the name of the thread given by the debugger. Often, this is just an index or
      unique id assigned to the thread. This field can be modified, but it has no effect on the
      target.</LI>

      <LI>Created - the snapshot when this thread was first observed. If the thread's creation was
      observed, then it is its creation time.</LI>

      <LI>Destroyed - if destroyed, the snapshot when this thread was last observed. If the
      thread's destruction was observed, then it is its destruction time.</LI>

      <LI>State - the thread's current state. For a dead trace, this is either ALIVE or TERMINATED,
      and depends solely on whether or not a destruction time was recorded. For a live trace, this
      may also take RUNNING, STOPPED, or UNKNOWN, depending on what is reported by the debugger.
      The state always reflects the present, or latest known, state.</LI>

      <LI>Comment - a user-modifiable comment about the thread.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2>Navigating Time</H2>

    <P>The user can navigate through time within the current trace by using the caret above the
    threads timeline. There are also actions for "stepping the trace" forward and backward. See the
    <A href="help/topics/DebuggerTimePlugin/DebuggerTimePlugin.html">Time</A> window for a way to
    display and navigate to specific events in the trace's timeline. Note that stepping away from
    the present will prevent most windows from interacting with the live target. While some
    components and scripts may interact with the target and record things "into the present," such
    updates may not appear on screen until the user steps back to the present. Stepping the trace
    does not affect the target, except that viewing the present requires querying the live target,
    which can perturb its state.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_snap_backward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow_up.png">Step Trace
    Snap Backward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there exists a snapshot previous to the current. It steps the
    trace backward to the previous snapshot, causing most windows to display the recorded data from
    the new point in time.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_snap_forward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow_down.png">Step Trace
    Snap Forward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when there exists a snapshot ahead of the current. It steps the
    trace forward to the next snapshot, causing most windows to display the recorded data from the
    new point in time.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_tick_backward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepback.png">Step Trace
    Tick Backward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when the current point in time includes emulated steps. It steps
    the trace backward to the previous tick.</P>

    <H3><A name="step_trace_tick_forward"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/stepinto.png">Step Trace Tick
    Forward</H3>

    <P>This action is available when a thread is selected. It steps the current thread forward to
    the next tick, using emulation. Note that emulation does not affect the target. Furthermore,
    emulation may halt early if it encounters certain instructions or causes an exception.</P>

    <H3><A name="seek_trace_present"></A><IMG alt="" src="images/continue.png">Seek Trace to
    Present</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available and is enabled by default. When first enabled, if the
    current trace is live, it immediately steps the trace to the present. Furthermore, as long as
    it is enabled and the current trace is live, whenever the recorder steps forward, the tool
    steps with it. In most cases, this option should remain on, otherwise stepping the target will
    not cause any windows to update. Toggling it off then on is a quick way to return to the
    present after browsing the past.</P>

    <H2>Other Actions</H2>

    <H3><A name="sync_focus"></A>Synchronize Trace and Target Focus</H3>

    <P>This toggle is always available and is enabled by default. While enabled, any changes in
    navigation coordinates are translated, to the extent possible, and sent to the connected
    debugger. This may, for example, issue <CODE>thread</CODE> and/or <CODE>frame</CODE> commands
    to GDB so that commands typed into its CLI will refer to the same thread and frame as is
    focused in Ghidra. Conversely, any debugger events which indicate a change in focus are
    translated, to the extent possible, into navigation coordinates and activated in Ghidra. For
    example, if the user issues a <CODE>frame</CODE> command to the CLI of a GDB connection, then
    Ghidra will navigate to that same frame.</P>
