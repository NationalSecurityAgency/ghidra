    <H1>Debugger Launchers: LLDB</H1>

    <P>Integration with LLDB is achieved using a plugin for LLDB's Python Scripting Bridge. It is
    well-suited for debuging user-space targets on a variety of platforms. It is the <EM>de
    facto</EM> debugger for macOS. It can be obtained by installing Xcode from the App Store.
    Though it may require a bit more careful configuration, it can also be obtained from other
    repositories like <TT>brew</TT>.</P>

    <P>The following launchers based on the LLDB Debugger are included out of the box:</P>

    <H2><A name="local"></A>Local</H2>

    <P>The plain "<TT>lldb</TT>" launch script defaults to launching the current program as a
    user-mode process on the local system. If there is no current program, or if you clear the
    <B>Image</B> option, this launcher will only start <TT>lldb</TT> and get it connected to a
    Ghidra trace. You may then manually start or connect to your target. Note that this may also
    require manual mapping of your program database(s) to the target memory.</P>

    <H3><A name="setup"></A>Setup</H3>

    <P>You must have LLDB installed on the local system, and it must support Python 3 scripting. If
    you have access to PyPI, setting up your Python 3 environment is done using Pip. Please note
    the version specifier for Protobuf.</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
python3 -m pip install psutil protobuf==3.20.3
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>If you are offline, or would like to use our provided packages, we still use Pip, but with a
    more complicated invocation:</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
cd /path/to/ghidra_<EM>
version</EM>/Ghidra/Debug
python3 -m pip install --no-index -f Debugger-rmi-trace/pypkg/dist -f Debugger-agent-lldb/pypkg/dist psutil protobuf
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Beware that LLDB may embed a different Python interpreter than your system's default. If you
    are still getting import errors, check the version that LLDB embeds:</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
(bash)$ lldb
(lldb) script
&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.version
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Note the version and ensure that you are invoking Pip with that version. Supposing
    <TT>sys.version</TT> indicates 3.10, you should invoke Pip using <TT>python3.10 -m
    pip</TT>.</P>

    <H3>Options</H3>

    <UL>
      <LI><B>Image</B>: This is the path to the target binary image (executable). Ghidra will try
      to fill this in based on information gathered when the current program was imported. If the
      file exists and is executable on the local machine, it will be filled in automatically.
      Otherwise, it is up to you to locate it. <B>NOTE:</B> If you have patched the current program
      database, these changes are <EM>not</EM> applied to the target. You can either 1) apply the
      same patches to the target once it is running, or 2) export a patched copy of your image and
      direct this launcher to run it.</LI>

      <LI><B>Arguments</B>: These are the command-line arguments to pass into the target. These are
      passed as is to LLDB's "<TT>settings set target.run-args ...</TT>" command.</LI>

      <LI><B><TT>lldb</TT> command</B>: This is the command or path to LLDB. We recommend version
      15 or later.</LI>

      <LI><B>Run command</B>: This is the LLDB command to actually launch the target. In most cases
      this should include "<TT>--stop-at-entry</TT>", since this will assure you an initial break
      and a chance to enable your breakpoints.</LI>

      <LI><B>Target TTY</B>: Depending on your target and/or personal preference, you may opt to
      separate the debugger's and the target's I/O. If you check this box, the launcher will use
      LLDB's "<TT>setting set target.output-path ...</TT>" command (and similar for the input) to
      direct the target's I/O to a second Terminal window.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Once running, you are presented with LLDB's command-line interface in Ghidra's Terminal.
    This is the <EM>bona fide</EM> LLDB command-line interface, so it has all the functionality you
    would expect. If you command LLDB from this shell, the plugin will keep Ghidra in sync. The
    terminal can be used to interact with the target application when it is running. The plugin
    provides an additional set of commands for managing the connection to Ghidra, as well as
    controlling trace synchronization. These are all in the "<TT>ghidra</TT>" category. You can use
    tab completion to enumerate the available commands and LLDB's "<TT>help</TT>" command to
    examine their documentation.</P>

    <H2><A name="remote"></A>Remote</H2>

    <P>This launcher can target any TCP-based GDB stub that is compatible with a local copy of
    <TT>lldb</TT>. Essentially, it just starts <TT>lldb</TT> and then enters</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
gdb-remote [host]:[port]
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>into it. It is best to test this command outside of Ghidra to be sure everything is
    compatible before using this launcher. This launcher does not require an image, nor does it
    create your target. Thus, it can be used without a current program.</P>

    <H3>Setup</H3>

    <P>On your local system, follow the steps given in <A href="#setup">LLDB Setup</A>. Your
    version of LLDB must be compatible with the stub (e.g., <TT>gdbserver</TT>) on the target
    system. There are no additional requirements on the target system.</P>

    <P><B>NOTE:</B> The target program image must match that imported in Ghidra, or else things may
    not map or synchronize correctly.</P>

    <H3>Options</H3>

    <UL>
      <LI><B>Host</B>: The host name of the target stub.</LI>

      <LI><B>Port</B>: The TCP port of the target stub.</LI>

      <LI><B>Architecture</B> (optional): If the stub does not describe its architecture to LLDB,
      you must set it before connecting. This is passed as is to "<TT>settings set
      target.default-arch ...</TT>" immediately before the "<TT>gdb-remote ...</TT>" command.</LI>

      <LI><B><TT>lldb</TT> command</B>: This works the same as in LLDB.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2><A name="macos_kernel"></A>macOS Kernel</H2>

    <P>This launcher connects to macOS kernels booted in debug-mode using <TT>lldb</TT>.
    Essentially, it just starts <TT>lldb</TT> and then enters</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
kdp-remote [host]
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>It is best to test this command outside of Ghidra to be sure everything is compatible before
    using this launcher. This launcher does not require an image, nor does it create your target.
    Thus, it can be used without a current program.</P>

    <H3>Setup</H3>

    <P>On your local system, follow the steps given in <A href="#setup">LLDB Setup</A>. Before
    connecting to the target kernel, you must force an NMI on the target to ready the connection.
    On actual hardware, this is typically achieved by some button sequence, e.g. <B>L/R-Options +
    Power</B> or <B>Command+Option+Control+Shift+Esc</B>. In a VM, you may have to pause the VM and
    modify its state. For example, by cd'ing to the VM's container and issuing the command:</P>

    <UL style="list-style-type: none">
      <LI>
<PRE>
perl -i -pe 's/(?&lt;=pendingNMI\x00{4})\x00/\x01/' macOS_15-1234567.vmss
</PRE>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <H3>Options</H3>

    <UL>
      <LI><B>Host</B>: The host IP of the target kernel.</LI>

      <LI><B>Architecture</B> (optional): If the kernel does not describe its architecture to LLDB,
      you must set it before connecting. This is passed as is to "<TT>settings set
      target.default-arch ...</TT>" immediately before the "<TT>kdp-remote ...</TT>" command.</LI>

      <LI><B><TT>lldb</TT> command</B>: This works the same as in LLDB.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2><A name="ssh"></A>Via SSH</H2>

    <P>This works the same as the <A href="help/topics/gdb/gdb.html#ssh">GDB via SSH</A> launcher,
    but runs <TT>lldb</TT> on a remote system via <TT>ssh</TT>.</P>

    <H2><A name="android"></A>Android</H2>

    <P>This has the same options as the <A href="#ssh">LLDB via SSH</A> launcher, which are
    necessary for connecting to the Android debugger, but executes via the normal lldb
    mechanism.</P>
