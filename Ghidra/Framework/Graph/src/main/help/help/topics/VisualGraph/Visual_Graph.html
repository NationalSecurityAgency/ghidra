    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Visual Graphs are highly integrated graphs that all share common features and
      actions. They typically have both a <A href="#Visual_Graph_Primary_View">Primary View</A> and 
      a <A href="#Satellite_View">Satellite View</A>
      
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Visual_Graph_Primary_View"></A>Primary View</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>      
      <P>The primary view is the main way to view and interact with the graph whose vertices
      and edges are specialized for the particular visual graph instance.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Satellite_View"></A>Satellite View</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Satellite View provides an overview of the graph. From this view you may also perform
      basic adjustment of the overall graph location. In addition to the complete graph, the
      satellite view contains a <B>lens</B> (the white rectangle) that indicates how much of the
      current graph fits into the primary view.</P>
      
      <P>The Satellite View can be in one of three states:  docked, undocked, or not showing. A
      docked satellite view will be display in a corner of the primary graph. An undocked view
      will be displayed in its own window. If the view is not showing, there will be an
      <IMG src= "images/network-wireless.png" alt="" border="1">icon in the corner to indicate that
      it is available.</P>

      <P>When you left-click in the satellite view the graph is centered around the
      corresponding point in the primary view. Alternatively, you may drag the lens of the
      satellite view to the desired location by performing a mouse drag operation on the lens.</P>

      <P>You may show/hide the satellite view by right-clicking anywhere in the Primary View and
      selecting or deselecting the <B>Display Satellite View</B> toggle button from the popup
      menu.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><IMG src="help/shared/tip.png" alt="" border="0"> If the Primary View is painting
        sluggishly, then hiding the Satellite View cause the Primary View to be more
        responsive.</P>

      <H3><A name="Satellite_View_Dock"></A>Detached Satellite</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The Satellite View is docked by default. However, you can choose to instead
        undock it and display it in its own window.</P>

        <P>To undock the Satellite View, right-click in the graph and deselect the <B>Dock
        Satellite View</B> menu item.</P>

        <P>To re-dock the Satellite View, right-click in the graph and select the <B>Dock Satellite
        View</B> menu item.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><IMG src="help/shared/tip.png" alt="" border="0"> To show the Satellite View if it is
        hidden, whether docked or undocked, you can press the <IMG src=
        "images/network-wireless.png" alt="" border="1"> button. This button is in the lower-right
        hand corner of the graph and is only visible if the Satellite View is hidden or
        undocked.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>When the Satellite View is attached, or <B>docked</B>, to the Primary View, you can
        choose which corner to show the satellite view. To change the corner, right-click in the
        graph, select <B>Docked Satellite Position</B> and then select the appropriate sub-menu for
        the desired corner.</P>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>There are various ways to move the graph. To move the graph in any direction you can
          drag from the whitespace of the graph.</P>

          <P>By default, the scroll wheel zooms the graph. The scroll wheel can also be used
          to scroll the graph vertically by holding the <TT><B>Ctrl</B></TT> key while
          using the scroll wheel. Alternatively, you can move the graph left to right using the
          mouse while holding <TT><B>Ctrl-Alt</B></TT>.</P>

          <P>The satellite viewer may also be used to move the primary graphs view by dragging and
          clicking inside of the satellite viewer.</P>

        <H3><A name="Zoom"></A>Zooming</H3>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>At <B>full zoom</B>, or <B>block level zoom</B>, each block is rendered at its natural
          size. From that point, which is a
          1:1 zoom level, you can zoom out in order to fit more of the graph into the display.</P>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>To change the zoom you may use the mouse scroll wheel. This works
            whether the mouse is over the primary viewer or the satellite viewer.</P>

          </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <P>The <A href="#Satellite_View">satellite viewer</A> is always zoomed out far enough to
          fit the entire graph into its window.</P>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

        <H3><A name="Interaction_Threshold"></A>Interaction Threshold</H3>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>While zooming out (away from the vertices) you will eventually reach a point where you
          can no longer interact with the component inside of the block. The blocks provide a subtle
          visual indication when they are zoomed past this level, in the form of a drop-shadow. The
          image below shows this drop-shadow. The block on the left is not past the interaction
          threshold, but the block on the right is, and thus has a drop-shadow. This example is for
          illustrative purposes only and during normal usage all blocks will share the save zoom
          level. So, if one block is zoomed past the interaction threshold, all other blocks will
          be as well.</P>

        <H3>Painting Threshold</H3>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>While zooming out (away from the blocks) you will eventually reach a point where
          contents each vertex will not be painted. Instead, each block will be painted by a
          rectangle that is painted with the current background color of the vertex.</P>
