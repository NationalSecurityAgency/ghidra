 * whether or not it operates on abstract or concrete values. The term "emulator" is reserved for
 * machines whose values always include a concrete piece. That piece doesn't necessarily have to be
 * a (derivative of) {@link BytesPcodeExecutorStatePiece}, but it usually is. To be called an
 * "emulator" implies that {@link PcodeArithmetic#toConcrete(Object, Purpose)} never throws
 * {@link ConcretionError} for any value in its state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For a complete example of a p-code emulator, see {@link PcodeEmulator}. For an alternative
 * implementation incorporating an abstract piece, see the Taint Analyzer.
