	 *   1: Original Version
	 *   2: Changed API to support NAT and firewalls
	 *   3: Allow user to login with alternate user ID
	 *   4: Added additional checkout data and database ID support (4.2)
	 *   5: Added support for quick update of checkout file following merged check-in on server,
	 *      also added alternate authentication via password file (4.4)
	 *   6: Refactored BufferFile related classes creating a ManagedBufferFile which
	 *      supports all the version-control capabilities. (5.2)
	 *   7: Added support for SSH authentication callback, anonymous user access (5.4)
	 *   8: Added salted local passwords, added LocalIndexedFilesystem V1 with ability to obtain file count (6.1)
	 *   9: Added support for transient checkouts (7.2)
	 *   10: Added BlockStreamServer (7.4)
	 *   11: Revised password hash to SHA-256 (9.0)
	 *       - version 9.1 switched to using SSL/TLS for RMI registry connection preventing
	 *         older clients the ability to connect to the server.  Remote interface remained
	 *         unchanged allowing 9.1 clients to connect to 9.0 server.
	 *   12: Revised RepositoryFile serialization to facilitate support for text-data used
	 *       for link-file storage.
