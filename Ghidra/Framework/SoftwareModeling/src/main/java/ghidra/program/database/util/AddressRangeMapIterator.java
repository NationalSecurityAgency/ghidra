/**
 * An iterator over ranges that have a defined values in the AddressRangeMapDB
 * <P>
 * NOTE: this iterator is complicated by the fact that there can exist a record that represents
 * an address range that "wraps around" from the max address to the 0 address, where this record
 * actually represents two address ranges. This is cause by changing the image base which shifts
 * all records up or down. That shift can cause a record to have a wrapping range where the start
 * address is larger than the end address. If such a record exists, it is found during construction
 * and the lower address range is extracted from the record and is stored as a special "start range"
 * that should be emitted before any other ranges in that space. The upper range of a wrapping
 * record will be handled more naturally during the iteration process. When a wrapping record is
 * encountered during the normal iteration, only the upper range is used and it will be in the
 * correct address range ordering.
