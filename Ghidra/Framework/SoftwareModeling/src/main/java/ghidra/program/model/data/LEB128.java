 * being reserved as a continuation flag, with the least significant bytes coming first 
 * (<b>L</b>ittle <b>E</b>ndian <B>B</b>ase <b>128</b>).
 * <p>
 * This implementation only supports reading values that decode to at most 64 bits (to fit into
 * a java long).

 * When reading a value, you must already know if it was written as a signed or unsigned value to
 * be able to decode it correctly.
