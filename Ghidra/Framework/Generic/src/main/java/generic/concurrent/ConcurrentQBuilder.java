/**
 * A helper class to build up the potentially complicated {@link ConcurrentQ}.
 * <P>
 * Note: you must supply either a {@link GThreadPool} instance or a thread pool name.  Further,
 * if you supply the name of a thread pool, then a private, non-shared pool will be used.  If you
 * wish to make use of a shared pool, then you need to create that thread pool yourself.  See
 * {@link GThreadPool#getSharedThreadPool(String)}.
 *
 * <P>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * <pre>{@literal
 * QCallback<I, R> callback = new AbstractQCallback<I, R>() {
 *     public R process(I item, TaskMonitor monitor) {
 *         // do work here...
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * ConcurrentQBuilder<I, R> builder = new ConcurrentQBuilder<I, R>();
 * builder.setThreadPoolName("Thread Pool Name");
 * builder.setQueue(new PriorityBlockingQueue());
 * concurrentQ = builder.build(callback);
 *
 * // OR, you can chain the builder calls:
 * ConcurrentQBuilder<I, R> builder = new ConcurrentQBuilder<I, R>();
 * queue = builder.setThreadPoolName("Thread Pool Name").
 * 				setQueue(new PriorityBlockingQueue()).
 * 				setMaxInProgress(1).
 * 				build(callback);
 *
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 *
 * Note: if you wish to take advantage of blocking when adding items to the {@link ConcurrentQ},
 *       see {@link #setQueue(Queue)}.
 *
 *
 *
 * @param <I> The type of the items to be processed.
 * @param <R> The type of objects resulting from processing an item
