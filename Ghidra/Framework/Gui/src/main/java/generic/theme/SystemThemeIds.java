/**
 * This class provides a set of IDs that can be used in the application, regardless of which Look
 * and Feel (LaF) is being used.
 * <P>
 * Various LaFs have different names for common concepts and even define additional concepts not
 * listed here. The values in this class are those the application uses use regardless of the LaF
 * being used. When we load a specific LaF, a {@link UiDefaultsMapper} specific to that LaF is used
 * to map its common LaF ids to these standard system ids. The {@link GThemeDefaults} uses these
 * system ids to define colors that can be used throughout the application without using these ids
 * directly.
 * <P>
 * The ids are assigned to categories as follows:
 * <UL>
 *      <LI>CONTROL- these ids are used for colors and fonts for general system components such as
 * 				Buttons, Checkboxes, or anything that doesn't fit into one of the other areas</LI>
 *  	<LI>VIEW - these ids are used for the colors and fonts used for widgets that display data
 *  			such as Trees, Tables, TextFieds, and Lists</LI>
 *  	<LI>MENU - these ids are used by menu components such as Menus and MenuItems.</LI>
 *  	<LI>TOOLTIP - these ids are used just by the tooltip component</LI>
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * For each of those categories the ids specify a specific property for those components.
 * <UL>
 * 		<LI> BG - the background color</LI>
 * 		<LI> FG - the foreground color</LI>
 * 		<LI> BG_SELECTED - the background color when the component is selected</LI>
 * 		<LI> FG_SELECTED - the foreground color when the component is selected</LI>
 * 		<LI> FG_DISABLED - the foreground color when the component is disabled</LI>
 * 		<LI> BG_BORDER - the border color</LI>
 * 		<LI> FONT - the font</LI>
 * </UL>
