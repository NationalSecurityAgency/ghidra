    <H1>Theming Overview</H1>

	<P>This document describes Ghidra's support for using and managing UI themes.
	</P>

    <H2>Goal</H2>

    <P>The primary goal of theming in Ghidra is to allow users to customize the appearance of the UI
    and to share that customization with the community.  We added infrastructure to Ghidra that 
    allows users/developers to completely configure the colors, fonts, and icons used within 
    the application. There are two main motivations for creating this feature. The first is to 
    provide the much requested "Dark Theme". Many users find Ghidra's current color scheme to be 
    hard on the eyes and have requested a dark color scheme. The 
    second motivation for creating this feature is for accessibility purposes. For example, the 
    theming feature allows the user to create a theme that uses high contrast colors and larger 
    fonts.</P>
    

    <H2>Background</H2>

    <P>Before theming, Ghidra used thousands of hard-coded colors, fonts, and icons. They were
    defined throughout the code in a somewhat haphazard fashion. Many features use colors to convey
    similar concepts, but no effort was made to use similar colors for similar concepts.
    Further, these colors were generally chosen to work with one of the common default Java Look and
    Feels. (A Java Look and Feel is a grouping of UI settings that define the appearance of the 
    application.)  Those original colors often looked terrible when used in conjunction with other 
    Look and Feels, especially dark ones.</P>

    <P>Ghidra did allow some customization of the current colors using the Ghidra Options API, but 
    this was inadequate for several reasons. One issue with this approach is that not all colors and
    fonts are changeable via the options. Another issue is that the options are tool-based and you 
    have to make the same customization for each tool. A third problem is that options are unrelated
    to the Look and Feel; you couldn't have different option choices depending on the current Look 
    and Feel.</P>

    <P>As mentioned, all of Ghidra's icons were hard-coded, with many not suitable for use in a dark
    theme.  Overall, the hard-coding of colors, fonts, and icons and the limitation of options made
    creating a good dark theme virtually impossible.  To address these issues, a new theming
    infrastructure was created.</P>

    <H2>General Concepts and Approach</H2>

    <P>To achieve a theming capability in Ghidra, we had to make the following changes:</P>
    	<OL>
    		<LI>Replace hard-coded values with a level of indirection for colors, fonts, and icons
    		using property names/IDs
    		</LI>
    		<LI>Create the concept of a theme that allows for the the property values to change
    		as a group and along with the current Look and Feel in use
    		</LI>
    		<LI>Create an API that allows for the introduction of system-level properties that can
    		be mapped to specific Look and Feel values in order to create reusable groups of properties
    		</LI>
    		<LI>Provide methods for changing the property values, along with the ability to create,
    		edit, save, export and import themes
    		</LI>
    	</OL>
    
    
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Indirection</H3>

      <P>The goal of using indirection is to remove all uses of hard-coded colors, fonts, and icons
      when developing a feature in the application. Instead, these objects will be indirectly
      referred to by an identifying string such as "color.bg.mywidget", where the string will
      follow a known convention that helps indicate its use. Default values for these identifying
      strings will be specified in data files that exist in the module where the code that defined
      the ID is located. The values associated with these IDs can be either a concrete value such
      as an actual color, font, or icon, or the value can be defined using a different property name, 
      allowing for properties to be defined by other properties.  This allows users to change
      individual values or entire groups of values with one edit.</P>

      <H3>Theme</H3>

      <P>A theme is simply the object that specifies all the values for colors, fonts, and icons
      used in the application, as well as the Look and Feel. This allows there to be a set of
      themes to choose from and by simply switching the theme, the system will then update the Look 
      and Feel along with the colors, fonts, and icons, all with one action. The set of themes to 
      choose from is a mix of built-in themes and saved custom themes. There is one built-in theme 
      for each supported Look and Feel.  The chosen theme will use the UI values defied by the Look 
      and Feel,  as well as all the values for the defined property IDs.  Users are able to 
      create custom themes to change any color, font, or icon defined by the application, along with
      UI values supplied by the associated Look and Feel.</P>

      <H3>Look and Feel Values</H3>

      <P>The Java Look and Feel is specified by the active theme. These Look and Feel objects
      define colors, fonts, and icons indirectly using identifying strings such as "Button.font"
      and "Menu.background". The Look and Feel mappings determine the default values used by all 
      GUI elements
      unless overridden by developers when they create the components.  With theming, users have the
      ability to change these Java Look and Feel defined values in the same way as theme properties 
      defined created by application code. Another concept used by Java Look and Feels is that of 
      shared UI patterns.
      Look and Feels typically share many of the same colors and those shared colors are defined 
      by the Look and Feel using a group name/key such as "control", "text", or "menu".  This allows
      for changes to be made at the group level or for the individual property.  The theme 
      framework captures this Java grouping information when creating a theme that for a given 
      Look and Feel.
      </P>

      <H3>User Interaction</H3>

      <P>Users will be able create, edit, delete, import, export, and of course switch the
      application's active theme. The GUI theme editor allows users to perform all of these actions.
      Using the active theme as a starting point, users will be able to change any color, font, or
      icon defined either by the Look and Feel or the application. One or more of these changes can
      be saved as a new theme and stored in a file in their application directory. Themes can be
      shared with other users by exporting and importing themes.</P>
