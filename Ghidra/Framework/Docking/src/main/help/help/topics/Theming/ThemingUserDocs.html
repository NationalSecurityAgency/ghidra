    <H2>Description</H2>
	<BlOCKQUOTE>

    <P>The Theming feature allows users to customize the colors, fonts, and icons used throughout
    the application. The active theme determines the Java Look and Feel, whether the theme should
    use light or dark defaults, and any custom colors, fonts, and icons that override the default
    values. Users can can easily switch between any of the built-in themes or any saved themes found
    in their home application directory</P>

    <P>Users can also edit and create their own themes using the Theme Editor. Custom themes are
    stored in the user's <code>&lt;home&gt;/.ghidra/.ghidra-&lt;version&gt/themes</code> directory. 
    These theme files are simple text files that can
    easily be modified using any text editor. Also, users can share themes by exporting them to a
    file that can be given to other users who can them import them into their application.</P>

    <H2>Theme Chooser Dialog<A name="Switch_Theme"></A></H2>
 	<BlOCKQUOTE>
    <P>The Theme Chooser allows users to switch themes.

    <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images/ThemeChooserDialog.png"><BR>
     &nbsp;</P>

    <P>The Theme Chooser dialog displays a list of all the know themes, both built-in and custom.
    As you pick different themes, the application will switch to that theme. Press the "OK" button
    when the desired theme is selected. Pressing the "Cancel" button will restore the theme to
    the what it was when the dialog was invoked.</P>
    
    </BlOCKQUOTE>
    
    <H2>Theme Editor Dialog<A name="Edit_Theme"></A></H2>
	<BlOCKQUOTE>

    <P>The Theme Editor Dialog is the primary means for creating and editing themes.</P>

    <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images/ThemeEditorDialog.png"><BR>
     &nbsp;</P>

    <P>The Theme Editor Dialog consists of a Look And Feel drop-down and a tabbed set of tables that
    display the values for every color property, font property, and icon property defined by either 
    the Java look and feel or the application. The properties fall into one of the following 
    groups</P>
    <UL>
    	<LI>Application Properties - these are application defined properties. They all start with
    	either "color.", "font.", or "icon.", depending on whether the property is a color, font,or
    	icon respectively.</LI>
    	<LI>System Properties - these are well defined Look and Feel concepts such as various 
    	standard background and foreground colors, border color, and fonts. These all start with
    	"system." and their values are mapped to specific values for each Java Look and Feel.</LI>
    	<LI>Look and Feel Properties - these are the properties defined by the current Java
    	Look and Feel. Ghidra prepends these properties with prefixes that start with either 
    	"laf.color.", "laf.font"., or "laf.icon." For example, if the Look and Feel defines a property 
    	called "Button.background", it would appear in Ghidra as "laf.color.Button.background".</LI>
    	<LI>Look and Feel Palette Properties - All the color and fonts used by the Look and Feel 
    	properties are grouped into either system property values or auto-generated palette 
    	properties, so that groups of properties can be changed together.</LI>
    
    </UL>
    
    <P>See the <A href="ThemingDeveloperDocs.html#Resource_Ids">Developer Documentation</A> for more
    details on the property ID format and naming conventions.
    </P>

    <P>Each table entry shows the property ID string, the current value, the theme value,
    and the default value. Most often, the three values are equal. If the theme value is different
    from the default value, that means that the active theme has overridden the default value for
    that property. If the current value is different from the theme value, that means the user has
    changed that value, but not yet saved the changes back to the theme.</P>

    <P>Individual values can be changed by double-clicking the value in the ID or Current Value 
    column. This will bring up an appropriate editor for changing the value. When editing a value, 
    the change
    takes place immediately in the application so you can see the effect. When you leave the
    specific property editor, you have the choice of keeping the change or canceling and having it
    revert back to its previous value.</P>

    <P>If any values have been changed, the <B>Save</B> button will become enabled, allowing you to save
    any changes you have made. (Pressing the <B>Dismiss</B> button will also give the the option to 
    save.) When saving, if the
    current theme is a built-in theme, you will first have to supply a new theme name. If the
    current theme is a not a built-in theme, you will have the option to overwrite the existing
    theme or supplying a new name to save it as a new theme.</P>

      allowing the user to choose a theme file
      to import. The selected file can be either a standard theme file or a Zip file containing the
      theme file and any non-standard icon files defined by that theme.</P>

    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Theme Property Names</H2>
	<BlOCKQUOTE>

    <P>Theme Property Names (also referred to as IDs or keys) that are defined by the application
    use a common format to help make sorting and viewing properties more intuitive as to their use. See
    the <A href="ThemingDeveloperDocs.html#Resource_Ids">Developer Documentation</A> for more details on the property ID
    format and naming conventions.</P>

	</BlOCKQUOTE>
    <H2>Theme Files</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>Theme Files are used to store saved custom themes. They are simple text files and are 
      stored in the user's home application directory under 
      <code>&lt;home&gt;/.ghidra/.ghidra-&lt;version&gt/themes</code>. The first three properties are always the
      theme name, the Look and Feel name, and whether the theme uses standard defaults or dark
      defaults. Finally, there is a list of overridden property "name = value" lines. The format
      is:</P>
    <CODE>
	<PRE>
        name = [theme name]
        Look and Feel = [Look and Feel name]
        useDarkDefaults = [true or false]
        
        [theme id 1]= [color, icon, or font value]
        [theme id 2]= [color, icon, or font value]
        [theme id 3]= [color, icon, or font value]
        [theme id 4]= [color, icon, or font value]
        ...
	</PRE>
	</CODE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Example:</P>
	<PRE>
        name = BigFontTheme
        Look and Feel = Nimbus
        useDarkDefaults = false
		
        color.bg = Black
        color.bg.foo = #012345
        [color]Panel.background = Red
        font.button = dialog-PLAIN-14
        icon.refresh = images/reload3.png    
        color.bg.bar = color.bg.foo   
        color.bg.xxx = [color]Panel.background
	</PRE>


      <P>Each property line is expected to begin with either "color.", "font.", or "icon." Since
      java defined properties don't start with these prefixes, they will have "[color]", "[font]",
      or "[icon]" prepended to their property name. These brackets are only used to aid in 
      parsing this file. When the properties are used in Ghidra, the bracketed prefixes are
      removed.</P>

      <P>Also, note that the values of these properties can reference other property names. If the
      right side of the assignment is a property name and not a value, then it must also use the
      bracketed prefix if the property name doesn't start with "color.", "font.", or "icon."</P>

      <H3>Specifying Theme Property Values</H3>
      
      <P>Specifying property values varies depending on whether it is a color, font, or icon. Fonts
      and icons also support specifying modifiers. For a complete description of how to specify
      these values, see the <A href="ThemingDeveloperDocs.html#Theme_Property_Values">Developer Documentation</A>.
