    <H1>Theming Architecture</H1>

    <P>This document describes the API for initializing and managing themes. A theme (the 
    <CODE>GTheme</CODE>
    class) in Ghidra represents a specific Look and Feel as well the set of values for the color,
    font, and icon resource IDs used in the application. Resource IDs are defined in theme properties
    files.   Application writers refer to these IDs when using colors, fonts and icons. 
    The <CODE>Gui</CODE> class provides a set of
    static methods that serves as the primary interface for managing all aspects of theming.</P>

    <H2>GTheme Class</H2>

    <P>The <CODE>GTheme</CODE> class is the implementation of the theme concept. At any given time, 
    the application is using resource values as specified by the active theme. The theme specifies
    the Java Look and Feel, whether or not the overall theme is "dark" (which determines which default
    values to use) and any resource values which have been overridden specifically by that theme.
    There are two types of of themes; built-in themes and file-based themes. Built-in
    themes are implemented directly as sub-classes of <CODE>GTheme</CODE> and simply specify a 
    Java Look and Feel
    and whether or not the theme is "dark". There is one "built-in" theme for each supported
    Look and Feel. File-based themes read their values from a theme file. Theme files are created by
    editing and saving existing themes.</P>

    <H2>GThemeValueMap / ThemeValue Classes</H2>

    <P>These are the base classes for storing values for resource IDs. A <CODE>GThemeValueMap</CODE>
    consists of three maps, one each for colors, fonts, and icons. Each map binds an ID to a
    appropriate subclass of <CODE>ThemeValue</CODE>, which is the base class for 
    <CODE>ColorValue</CODE>, <CODE>FontValue</CODE>, and
    <CODE>IconValue</CODE>. Resource values are stored in these <CODE>ThemeValue</CODE> sub-classes 
    because the value can be
    either a concrete value or be a reference to some other resource of the same type. So, for
    example, "color.bg.foo" could map directly to an actual color or its value could be reference
    to some other indirect color like "color.bg.bar". In any <CODE>ThemeValue</CODE> object, either 
    the referenced ID or the direct value must be null. To get the ultimate concrete value, there
    is a convenience method called <CODE>get()</CODE> on <CODE>ThemeValue</CODE>s that takes a 
    <CODE>GThemeValueMap</CODE> as an argument.
    This method will recursively resolve reference IDs, which is why it needs a value map as an
    argument.</P>

    <P><CODE>GThemeValueMap</CODE>s have some convenience methods for performing set operations. 
    You can load
    values from other <CODE>GThemeValueMap</CODE>s into this map, which adds to the current map, 
    replacing values with the same ID with values from the other map. Also, there is a method for 
    getting the differences from one GThemeValueMap to another.</P>

    <H2>Gui Class</H2>

    <P>The <CODE>Gui</CODE> class is a set of static methods that provides the primary API for 
    managing themes.
    It has methods for switching themes, adding themes, deleting themes, saving themes, restoring
    themes, getting/setting values for resource IDs, adding theme listeners, and others.  This 
    class is meant to be used by application developers, along with <CODE>GColor</CODE> for colors
    and <CODE>GIcon</CODE> for icons.   Fonts are handled slightly differently by making calls to
    <CODE>Gui.registerFont(Component, Id)</CODE> 
    </P>

    <H2>Application Initialization</H2>

    <P>Applications need to call <CODE>Gui.initialize()</CODE> before any uses of color, fonts, or 
    icons occur.
    This will load all resource defaults from all <CODE>*.theme.properties</CODE> files, read the 
    last used theme from preferences, and load that theme which includes setting the Look and Feel.
    </P>

    <H2>Loading a Theme</H2>

    <P>Loading a theme consists of two main operations: loading the Look and Feel and building the
    set of values for all defined resource IDs.</P>

    <H2>Loading the Look and Feel</H2>

    <P>Because each Look and Feel presents different challenges to the theming feature, there is a
    <CODE>LookandFeelManager</CODE> for each Look and Feel. The <CODE>LookandFeelManager</CODE> is 
    responsible for installing
    the Look and Feel (in the case of Nimbus, we had to install a special subclass of the
    <CODE>NimbusLookandFeel</CODE>), extracting the Java resources mappings (Java Look and Feel 
    objects also use a resource ID concept), group the Java resources into common groups, possibly 
    fix up some issues specific to that Look and Feel, possibly install global properties, and have 
    specific update  techniques to get that Look and Feel to update its component UIs when 
    values change.</P>

    <H2>Creating the Active Theme Values</H2>

    <P>After the Look and Feel is loaded and the Java values extracted, the final resource mapping is
    created. This is done by loading various resource values sets (each stored in a GThemeValueMap)
    in the correct order into a new <CODE>GThemeValueMap</CODE> in <CODE>ThemeManager</CODE> called
    "currentValues" . When values are loaded into a <CODE>GThemeValueMap</CODE>, they will replace 
    any existing values with the same ID. The values are loaded in the following order:</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <UL>
        <LI>Java defaults (values from Look and Feel)</LI>

        <LI>application defaults (from *.theme.properties files)</LI>

        <LI>applications dark defaults (if theme is dark)</LI>

        <LI>theme values (values that were overridden by a specific theme)</LI>
      </UL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Changing Values Associated With Resource Ids</H2>

    <P>Whenever the value associated with a resource ID changes, the application gets notified in
    various ways to update the display with the new value. The technique used to notify the
    application differs depending on the resource type and the Look and Feel (these differences are
    captured in the <CODE>LookandFeelManager</CODE> sub-classes for each Look and Feel). It can also
    vary depending on whether the value is an application defined resource or a Java defined
    resource.</P>

    <H3>Updating Colors</H3>

    <P>Updating Colors is the easiest of all the resource types. First 
    <CODE>GColor.refreshAll()</CODE> is called,
    which causes every <CODE>GColor</CODE> to refresh its internal delegate <CODE>Color</CODE>.
    This is the purpose of using the <CODE>GColor</CODE> class, to introduce a level of indirection 
    that allows us to change runtime behavior without having to recompile.
    Next, <CODE>repaint()</CODE> is called on all the top-level Java windows in the application. 
    Also, since color values in the <CODE>UIDefaults</CODE> are actually
    replaced with GColor objects, this technique works for both application defined resources and
    Java defined resources.</P>

    <H3>Updating Icons</H3>

    <P>Updating icons is a mixed bag. If the icon is application defined, 
    <CODE>GIcon.refreshAll()</CODE> is
    called which causes every <CODE>GIcon</CODE> to refresh its internal delegate icon and then 
    call <CODE>repaint()</CODE> on all the
    windows. If the icon is Java defined, then the <CODE>UIDefaults</CODE> has to be updated and the
    <CODE>updateComponentTreeUI()</CODE> method on all windows is called.</P>

    <H3>Updating Fonts</H3>

    <P>Updating Fonts is a bit more involved than updating colors and icons, due to the inability
    to use the indirection model when working with fonts. First, if the changed font is Java 
    defined, the <CODE>UIDefaults</CODE> for that font ID (and any that derive from it) are updated. 
    Next, all the components that have called <CODE>Gui.registeredFont()</CODE> are updated. (The
    registration system for fonts is what allows us to notify components of updates, since fonts
    cannot use the indirection model.)
    Finally, the <CODE>updateComponentTreeUI()</CODE> method is
    called on all windows in the application.</P>



    <H2>Creating/Editing/Saving Themes</H2>

    <P>New themes can be created and saved to files in the theme directory in the user's
    application directory (<code>&lt;home&gt;/.ghidra/.ghidra-&lt;version&gt/themes</code>). 
    When the application is started, this directory is scanned and any
    <CODE>*.theme</CODE> files are loaded and available to be selected as the active theme. 
    The <CODE>Gui</CODE> class has
    methods for setting the value of a color, font, or icon for a given resource ID. If any values
    are currently different from the active theme, the theme can be saved. If the active theme is a
    built-in theme, then the only choice is to save using a new theme name. Saving the
    theme will create a new "xyz.theme" file where "xyz" is the name of the theme. Otherwise, the
    existing theme file can be overwritten or a new theme name can be supplied to save to a new
    file.</P>

    <H2>External Icons</H2>

    <P>When setting icons for an icon resource ID, the user has the option of using an icon that
    exists in the application (on the classpath) or using any supported icon file (.png or .gif) on
    the filesystem.  If the user
    chooses to use a non-application icon file, then that icon will be copied into an images 
    directory in their application directory. These icons are considered external in that if the 
    theme were given to another user, you would also need to give them these icon files, as they 
    will not exist in other application installations.</P>

    <H2>Importing/Exporting Themes</H2>

    <P>Themes can be shared with other users by exporting and importing themes. When exporting a
    theme that doesn't use any external icons (icons not on the classpath), the theme can be
    exported to a <CODE>.theme</CODE> file of the user's choosing. If the theme does contain 
    external icons, the
    user has the option to save the theme as a .zip file, which would contain both the .theme file
    and all the external icon files.</P>

    <H2>Look and Feel Notes</H2>

    <P>Getting the theming feature to work on all the various Java Look and Feels is a
    challenge. Java created the concept of <CODE>UIDefaults</CODE>, which is a mapping of property 
    names
    to values. The implication is that users can change Look and Feel settings by changing values
    in the <CODE>UIDefaults</CODE>. Unfortunately, not all Look and Feels support this concept. 
    Nimbus and GTK+, in particular are problematic. Nimbus somewhat honors values in 
    <CODE>UIDefaults</CODE>, but only if those values are
    installed before Nimbus is loaded. So for our theming purposes, we had to extend the Nimbus
    Look and Feel in order to override the <CODE>getDefaults()</CODE> method (this is the method 
    where Look and Feels populate the <CODE>UIDefaults</CODE>) so that we can install any overridden 
    values from the selected theme. Also, since Nimbus does not respect changes to these values after
    they have been created, every time a Java defined property changes, we have to re-install the
    Nimbus Look and Feel.  The GTK+ Look and Feel is even more problematic. It gets many of its 
    properties
    from native libraries and there doesn't appear to be anyway of changing them. Therefore, themes
    based on GTK+ doesn't allow for changing Java defined values. To compensate for the
    differences among Look and Feels, we created a <CODE>LookandFeelManager</CODE> base class with 
    sub-classes for each Look and Feel.</P>
