	 * Overridden to change the Java's key event processing to insert Ghidra's top level tool
	 * key bindings into the event processing.  Java's normal key event processing is:
	 * <ol>
	 *     <li>KeyListeners on the focused Component</li>
	 *     <li>InputMap and ActionMap actions for the Component</li>
	 *     <li>InputMap and ActionMap actions for the Component's parent, and so on up the
	 *         Swing hierarchy</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * Ghidra has altered this flow to be:
	 * <ol>
	 *     <li><b>Reserved keybinding actions</b></li>
	 *     <li>KeyListeners on the focused Component</li>
	 *     <li>InputMap and ActionMap actions for the Component</li>
	 *     <li><b>Ghidra tool-level actions</b></li>
	 *     <li>InputMap and ActionMap actions for the Component's parent, and so on up the
	 *         Swing hierarchy</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * This updated key event processing allows individual components to handle key events first,
	 * but then allows global Ghidra key bindings to be processed, allowing normal Java processing
	 * after Ghidra has had its chance to process the event.
	 * <P>
	 * There are some exceptions to this processing chain:
	 * <ol>
	 *      <li>We don't do any processing when the focused component is an instance of
	 *          <code>JTextComponent</code>.</li>
	 *      <li>We don't do any processing if the active window is an instance of
	 *          <code>DockingDialog</code>.</li>
