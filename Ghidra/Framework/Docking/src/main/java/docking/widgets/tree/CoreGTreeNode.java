/**
 * This class exists to help prevent threading errors in {@link GTreeNode} and subclasses,
 * by privately maintaining synchronous access to the parent and children of a node. 
 * <P>
 * This implementation uses a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} to store its children. The theory is
 * that this will allow direct thread-safe access to the children without having to worry about
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}s while iterating the children.  Also, the assumption
 * is that accessing the children will occur much more frequently than modifying the children.  
 * This should only be a problem if a direct descendant of GTreeNode creates its children by calling
 * addNode many times. But in that case, the tree should be using Lazy or 
 * SlowLoading nodes which always load into another list first and all the children will be set 
 * on a node in a single operation.
 * <P>
 * Subclasses that need access to the children can call the {@link #children()} method which will
 * ensure that the children are loaded (not null). Since this class uses a
 * {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList}, subclasses that call the {@link #children()} method can safely
 * iterate the list without having to worry about getting a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  
 * <P>
 * This class uses synchronization to assure that the parent/children relationship is stable across
 * threads.  To avoid deadlocks, the sychronization strategy is that if you have the lock on
 * a parent node, you can safely acquire the lock on any of its descendants, but never its 
 * ancestors.  To facilitate this strategy, the {@link #getParent()} is not synchronized, but it
 * is made volatile to assure the current value is always used.
 * <P>
 * Except for the {@link #doSetChildren(List)} method, all other calls that mutate the
 * children must be called on the swing thread.  The idea is that bulk operations can work efficiently
 * by avoiding constantly switching to the swing thread to mutate the tree. This works because
 * the bulk setting of the children generates a coarse "node structure changed" event, which causes the
 * underlying {@link JTree} to rebuild its internal cache of the tree.  Individual add/remove operations
 * have to be done very carefully such that the {@link JTree} is always updated on one change before any
 * additional changes are done.  This is why those operations are required to be done on the swing
 * thread, which combined with the fact that all mutate operations are synchronized, keeps the JTree
 * happy.
