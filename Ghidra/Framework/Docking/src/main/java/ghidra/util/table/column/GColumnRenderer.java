/**
 * An interface for the {@link DynamicTableColumn}.  This allows the filtering system to stay
 * in sync with the rendering system by using the display text to filter.
 * 
 * <P>Table filtering in {@link GTable}s typically works with the following setup:
 * <OL>
 * 	<LI>The table has a text field that allows for quick filtering across all <B>visible</B> 
 *      columns.  The specifics of how the text filter works are defined by the 
 *      {@link RowFilterTransformer}, which is controlled by the user via the button at the right
 *      of the filter field.  (In the absence of this button, filters are typically a 'contains'
 *      filter.)
 *      
 *      <P>The default transformer turns items to strings by, in order,:
 *      <OL>
 *      	<LI>checking the <b>column</b> renderer's 
 *      		{@link #getFilterString(Object, Settings)},if a column renderer is installed
 *      	</LI>
 *      	<LI>checking to see if the column value is an instance of {@link DisplayStringProvider}
 *      	</LI>
 *      	<LI>checking to see if the column value is a {@link JLabel}
 *      	</LI>
 *      	<LI>calling <code>toString()</code> on the object
 *      	</LI>
 *      </OL>
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *  	The table has the ability to perform advanced filtering based upon specific columns.  Each
 *  	column's type is used to find dynamically discovered {@link ColumnConstraint}s.  These
 *  	constraints dictate how a given column can be filtered.  The user will create filters
 *  	using these constraints in the {@link ColumnFilterDialog} by pressing the 
 *  	button at the far right of the filter text field.
 *  	
 *  	<P>The way the constraints are used in the filtering system, in conjunction with 
 *  	   this renderer, is defined by the {@link ColumnConstraintFilterMode} via
 *  	   {@link #getColumnConstraintFilterMode()}.
 *  </LI>
 *  <LI>
 *  	Any custom filters, defined by individual clients (this is outside the scope of the 
 *  	default filtering system)
 *  </LI>
 * </OL>
 * 
 * <P><B>Note: The default filtering behavior of this class is to only filter on the aforementioned
 *       filter text field.  That is, column constraints will not be enabled by default. To
 *       change this, change the value returned by {@link #getColumnConstraintFilterMode()}.</B>
 * 
 * @param <T> the column type
