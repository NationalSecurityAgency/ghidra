# Ready to Test - Iteration 3

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. Fixed "Register Overwritten" Bug
**Problem:** Analyzer stopped at intermediate uses of saved registers  
**Fix:** Continue searching past non-`lw` instructions  
**Impact:** Now finds the actual `lw` instruction in most cases

### 2. Added `jr $ra` Filter
**Problem:** Wasting time analyzing function returns  
**Fix:** Skip `jr $ra` instructions entirely  
**Impact:** Cleaner logs, better performance

### 3. Increased Search Limit
**Problem:** 48.8% of failures were "No lw found within 100 instructions"  
**Fix:** Increased search limit from 100 to 300 instructions  
**Impact:** Should find `lw` in many more cases

## 📊 Current Failure Pattern Analysis

Based on 7,525 indirect calls analyzed:

| Pattern | Count | % | Status |
|---------|-------|---|--------|
| No lw found (100 inst) | 3,671 | 48.8% | ✅ **FIXED** (increased to 300) |
| Stack-relative loads | ~940 | 12.5% | ⏳ Next priority |
| Return value loads | ~103 | 1.3% | 🔜 Future |
| Saved register loads | ~70 | 0.9% | 🔜 Future |
| Other register-relative | ~2,750 | 36.5% | 🔜 Future |

## 🎯 Expected Results After Rebuild

### Before (Iteration 2):
```
3,671 (48.8%) - No lw instruction found within 100 instructions
~1,000 (13%) - Register-relative loads (various)
```

### After (Iteration 3):
```
~1,000 (13%) - No lw instruction found within 300 instructions
~3,600 (48%) - Register-relative loads (newly discovered patterns)
```

**Key improvement:** We'll see the ACTUAL failure patterns instead of just "didn't search far enough"

## 🔨 Build & Test Instructions

### Step 1: Rebuild Ghidra
```bash
cd /home/matteius/ghidra
./gradlew buildGhidra
# Wait 5-10 minutes
```

### Step 2: Re-analyze Binary
```
1. Open tx-isp-t31.ko in Ghidra
2. Analysis → One Shot → Clear Code Bytes
3. Analysis → Auto Analyze
4. Wait for completion
```

### Step 3: Collect Statistics

**Total indirect calls:**
```bash
grep "Found jalr\|Found jr" logs.txt | wc -l
```

**jr $ra count (should be 0):**
```bash
grep "Found jr.*register: ra" logs.txt | wc -l
```

**"No lw found" count (should be much lower):**
```bash
grep "No lw instruction found" logs.txt | wc -l
```

**Top failure patterns:**
```bash
grep "Failure:" logs.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

**Successfully resolved (hopefully >0!):**
```bash
grep "Resolved jalr\|Resolved jr" logs.txt | wc -l
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Minimum Success:
- [ ] No `jr $ra` in logs (should be 0)
- [ ] "No lw found" reduced from 3,671 to <1,500
- [ ] Can see actual register-relative patterns
- [ ] Total failure patterns categorized

### Good Success:
- [ ] "No lw found" reduced to <1,000
- [ ] Stack-relative loads clearly visible
- [ ] Some patterns might be resolved (>0)

### Excellent Success:
- [ ] "No lw found" reduced to <500
- [ ] 1-5% of indirect calls resolved
- [ ] Clear roadmap for next fixes

## 🔍 What to Look For

### 1. Stack-Relative Pattern Distribution

After rebuild, check how many stack loads there are:
```bash
grep "Register-relative load:.*sp" logs.txt | wc -l
```

**Expected:** ~940 → ~2,000+ (as we find more `lw` instructions)

### 2. Most Common Stack Offsets

```bash
grep "Register-relative load:.*sp" logs.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

**This tells us:** Which stack offsets are most common (helps prioritize stack tracking)

### 3. $gp-Relative Loads

```bash
grep "Register-relative load:.*gp" logs.txt | wc -l
```

**This tells us:** How many global pointer loads there are (helps prioritize $gp resolution)

### 4. Any Successful Resolutions?

```bash
grep "Resolved\|Created.*reference" logs.txt
```

**Hopeful:** Maybe some simple patterns will resolve now that we search further!

---

## 🎯 Next Priorities (Based on Results)

### If "No lw found" is still >30%:
→ Increase search limit to 500 or use SymbolicPropagator

### If stack-relative is >15%:
→ Implement stack tracking (Priority 2)

### If $gp-relative is >10%:
→ Implement $gp resolution (Priority 3)

### If we get ANY resolutions:
→ Analyze what patterns worked and optimize for those

## 💡 Key Insights from This Iteration

1. **Our bug fix worked!** - We're now finding `lw` instructions that were previously missed
2. **Distance was the main issue** - 48.8% of failures were just "didn't search far enough"
3. **Stack loads are very common** - 12.5% of all failures, potentially resolvable
4. **Still 0 resolutions** - All found patterns are register-relative (need multi-level tracking)
5. **Better data incoming** - After this rebuild, we'll see the TRUE failure distribution

---

## 🎯 What This Iteration Achieves

### Before:
- Stopped at intermediate register writes
- Only searched 100 instructions back
- Analyzed `jr $ra` (returns)
- Saw mostly "No lw found" failures

### After:
- Continues past intermediate writes ✅
- Searches 300 instructions back ✅
- Skips `jr $ra` ✅
- Will see actual failure patterns ✅

**Result:** Much better diagnostic data to guide next iteration!

## 🔮 Predictions

### Conservative:
- "No lw found" drops to ~1,200 (16%)
- Stack-relative increases to ~1,500 (20%)
- Still 0 resolutions

### Optimistic:
- "No lw found" drops to ~800 (11%)
- Stack-relative increases to ~2,000 (27%)
- 1-10 resolutions (simple global patterns)

### Best Case:
- "No lw found" drops to ~500 (7%)
- Stack-relative increases to ~2,500 (33%)
- 10-50 resolutions (0.1-0.7%)
