# Ready for Testing - MIPS Function Pointer Analyzer

## 🎯 Status: CODE COMPLETE ✅

All code changes are complete and compiled successfully. Ready for rebuild and testing.

---

## 📦 What Was Done

### 1. Added JR Instruction Support
- ✅ Analyzer now detects both `jalr` (calls) and `jr` (jumps)
- ✅ Creates appropriate reference types (COMPUTED_CALL vs COMPUTED_JUMP)
- ✅ Skips `jr $ra` (function returns)
- ✅ Logs found instructions with register names

### 2. Enhanced Backward Tracking
- ✅ Increased search distance from 30 to 100 instructions
- ✅ Split into modular methods for better maintainability
- ✅ Added detailed debug logging
- ✅ Validates resolved addresses point to actual code

### 3. Improved Code Quality
- ✅ Removed broken SymbolicPropagator code
- ✅ Added comprehensive error messages
- ✅ Better code organization
- ✅ Compiles without errors or warnings

## 🔨 Build Instructions

### Step 1: Rebuild Ghidra
```bash
cd /home/matteius/ghidra
./gradlew buildGhidra
```

**Expected time:** 5-10 minutes  
**Expected result:** `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`

### Step 2: Restart Ghidra
- Close Ghidra completely
- Launch from the new build:
  ```bash
  cd /home/matteius/ghidra/build/dist/ghidra_12.1_DEV
  ./ghidraRun
  ```

### Step 3: Re-analyze Binary
- Open project: `/home/matteius/tx-isp-t31`
- Open file: `tx-isp-t31.ko`
- **Option A:** Clear and re-analyze
  - Analysis → One Shot → Clear Code Bytes
  - Analysis → Auto Analyze
- **Option B:** Run specific analyzer
  - Analysis → One Shot → MIPS Function Pointer Analyzer

## 🔍 What to Look For

### In the Console/Logs

**Success Indicators:**
```
INFO  Found jalr call at <address> (MipsFunctionPointerAnalyzer)
INFO  Resolved jalr call at <address> to <target> (MipsFunctionPointerAnalyzer)
```

```
INFO  Found jr jump at <address> (MipsFunctionPointerAnalyzer)
INFO  Resolved jr jump at <address> to <target> (MipsFunctionPointerAnalyzer)
```

**Failure Indicators:**
```
INFO  Could not resolve jalr call target at <address> (register: <reg>)
INFO  Could not resolve jr jump target at <address> (register: <reg>)
```

**Debug Messages (if enabled):**
```
DEBUG Found lw instruction at <address> that loads into <reg>
DEBUG Resolved from data reference: <data_addr> -> <func_addr>
DEBUG Resolved from operand: <data_addr> -> <func_addr>
DEBUG Could not resolve lw at <address> - may be register-relative
```

### In the Decompiler

**Before (Broken):**
```c
code *UNRECOVERED_JUMPTABLE;
UNRECOVERED_JUMPTABLE = *(code **)(*(int *)(param_1 + 0xc) + 0x1c);
/* WARNING: Could not recover jumptable at 0x0001fb1c. Too many branches */
/* WARNING: Treating indirect jump as call */
uVar1 = (*UNRECOVERED_JUMPTABLE)();
```

**After (Fixed - if pattern works):**
```c
callback_func = *(code **)(*(int *)(param_1 + 0xc) + 0x1c);
if (callback_func != NULL) {
    return (*callback_func)();  // Clean call, no warnings
}
```

### In the Assembly Listing

**Look for references:**
```assembly
0000f62c  jr      $t9    →  points to target function
```

Right-click on the `jr` instruction → Show References To/From

**Expected:**
- Should see a reference to the target function
- Reference type: COMPUTED_JUMP or COMPUTED_CALL

## 📊 Expected Results

### Realistic Expectations

**Best Case:**
- 1-10% of indirect calls resolved (~200-2,000 out of 20,000)
- Patterns that work: Global function pointers, direct loads
- Some decompiler warnings eliminated

**Likely Case:**
- 0-1% of indirect calls resolved (~0-200 out of 20,000)
- Most failures due to register-relative patterns
- Minimal improvement in decompilation

**Why Low Success Rate?**
The logs show that most indirect calls in tx-isp-t31.ko use complex patterns:
- Register-relative loads: `lw $t9, 0x1c($a0)`
- Multi-level indirection: `arg1->field->function_ptr`
- Computed addresses: `base + index * 4`

These patterns require more sophisticated tracking (SymbolicPropagator with ContextEvaluator or multi-level tracking).

### Test Cases

**Primary Test Case:**
- Function: `tx_isp_send_event_to_remote`
- Address: 0xf60c
- Pattern: `lw $t9, 0x1c($a0); jr $t9`
- **Expected:** ❌ FAIL (register-relative pattern)

**Secondary Test Cases:**
Look for patterns like:
```assembly
lw      $t9, offset($gp)     # Global pointer
jalr    $t9
```

These have a better chance of working.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Issue 1: Register-Relative Patterns Don't Work
**Pattern:**
```assembly
lw      $t9, 0x1c($a0)       # Load from register + offset
jr      $t9
```

**Why it fails:**
- No data reference exists (runtime-dependent)
- Operand doesn't contain an Address object
- Would need to track $a0 value

**Solution:** Implement multi-level tracking (future work)

### Issue 2: MipsSwitchTableAnalyzer False Positives
**Problem:** Thousands of warnings about string data being treated as switch tables

**Impact:** Log spam, performance degradation

**Solution:** Add validation to reject non-executable memory (future work)

### Issue 3: Test Function Not Analyzed
**Problem:** Function at 0xf60c wasn't analyzed in previous run

**Possible causes:**
- Function not detected
- Address range restriction
- Analyzer dependencies

**Solution:** Manually trigger analysis on that function

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If No Calls Are Resolved

**Check 1: Is the analyzer running?**
```
Window → Console
Look for: "Found jalr call at..." or "Found jr jump at..."
```

**Check 2: Are debug messages enabled?**
Change `Msg.debug()` to `Msg.info()` in the code to see more details.

**Check 3: What patterns are failing?**
Look at the assembly around failed calls:
- Is it register-relative?
- Is it computed?
- Is the lw instruction too far away?

### If Analyzer Crashes

**Check the console for exceptions:**
```
ERROR  Exception in MipsFunctionPointerAnalyzer: ...
```

**Common causes:**
- Null pointer when reading memory
- Invalid address calculation
- Memory access exception

**Solution:** Add more null checks and try-catch blocks

### If Decompilation Doesn't Improve

**Possible reasons:**
1. Reference was created but decompiler doesn't use it
2. Jump table override didn't work
3. Decompiler cache needs to be cleared

**Solution:**
- Close and reopen the function
- Clear decompiler cache: Edit → Tool Options → Decompiler → Clear Cache

## 📝 Next Steps After Testing

### If Some Calls Resolve Successfully

**Document the working patterns:**
1. Find resolved calls in the logs
2. Navigate to those addresses
3. Document the assembly pattern
4. Create test cases for those patterns

**Enhance the analyzer:**
1. Identify common working patterns
2. Optimize for those patterns
3. Add pattern-specific heuristics

### If No Calls Resolve

**Analyze the failures:**
1. Enable debug logging
2. Find the most common failure patterns
3. Prioritize which patterns to fix first

**Implement advanced tracking:**
1. Multi-level tracking for register-relative patterns
2. SymbolicPropagator with ContextEvaluator
3. Increase search distance for far loads

### If Analyzer Crashes

**Debug and fix:**
1. Identify the crash location
2. Add null checks and error handling
3. Test on smaller address ranges first

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked
1. ✅ Detecting both jalr and jr instructions
2. ✅ Creating appropriate reference types
3. ✅ Jump table override to suppress warnings
4. ✅ Modular code structure for maintainability

### What Didn't Work
1. ❌ Simple SymbolicPropagator.getRegisterValue() approach
2. ❌ Assuming most patterns would be simple loads
3. ❌ 30-instruction search limit was too small

### What We Learned
1. 💡 Most indirect calls in embedded code use complex patterns
2. 💡 SymbolicPropagator requires ContextEvaluator for proper use
3. 💡 Need to validate assumptions with real-world testing
4. 💡 Detailed logging is essential for debugging
