<a name="sleigh_defining_tokens"></a>6.1. Defining Tokens and Fields</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
A <span class="emphasis"><em>token</em></span> is one of the byte-sized pieces that make
up the machine code instructions being modeled.
Instruction <span class="emphasis"><em>fields</em></span> must be defined on top of
them. A <span class="emphasis"><em>field</em></span> is a logical range of bits within
an instruction that can specify an opcode, or an operand etc. Together
tokens and fields determine the basic interpretation of bits and how
many bytes the instruction takes up. To define a token and the fields
associated with it, we use the <span class="bold"><strong>define
token</strong></span> statement.
</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
define token <span class="bold"><strong>tokenname</strong></span> ( <span class="bold"><strong>integer</strong></span> )
  <span class="bold"><strong>fieldname</strong></span>=(<span class="bold"><strong>integer</strong></span>,<span class="bold"><strong>integer</strong></span>) <span class="bold"><strong>attributelist</strong></span>
  <span class="weak">...</span>
;
</pre></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The first part of the definition defines the name of a token and the
number of bits it uses (this must be a multiple of 8). Following this
there are one or more field declarations specifying the name of the
field and the range of bits within the token making up the field. The
size of a field does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to be a multiple of
8. The range is inclusive where the least significant bit in the token
is labeled 0. The endianess of the processor will effect this labeling
when defining tokens that are bigger than 1 byte.  After each field
declaration, there can be zero or more of the following attribute
keywords:
</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
signed
hex
dec
</pre></div>
<p>
These attributes are defined in the next section. There can be any
manner of repeats and overlaps in the fields so long as they all have
different names.
</p>

<a name="idm140310875384864"></a>6.2. Fields as Family Symbols</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
Fields are the most basic form of family symbol; they define a natural
map from instruction bits to a specific symbol as follows. We take the
set of bits within the instruction as given by the field&#8217;s defining
range and treat them as an integer encoding. The resulting integer is
both the display portion and the semantic meaning of the specific
symbol. The display string is obtained by converting the integer into
either a decimal or hexadecimal representation (see below), and the
integer is treated as a constant varnode in any semantic action.
</p>
<p>
The attributes of the field affect the resulting specific symbol in
obvious ways. The <span class="bold"><strong>signed</strong></span> attribute
determines whether the integer encoding should be treated as just an
unsigned encoding or if a twos-complement encoding should be used to
obtain a signed integer. The <span class="bold"><strong>hex</strong></span>
or <span class="bold"><strong>dec</strong></span> attributes describe whether
the integer should be displayed with a hexadecimal or decimal
representation. The default is hexadecimal. [Currently
the <span class="bold"><strong>dec</strong></span> attribute is not supported]

<a name="idm140310875379232"></a>6.3. Attaching Alternate Meanings to Fields</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
The default interpretation of a field is probably the most natural but
of course processors interpret fields within an instruction in a wide
variety of ways. The <span class="bold"><strong>attach</strong></span> keyword
is used to alter either the display or semantic meaning of fields into
the most common (and basic) interpretations. More complex
interpretations must be built up out of tables.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="idm140310875377152"></a>6.3.1. Attaching Registers</h4></div></div></div>
<p>
Probably <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> most common processor interpretation
of a field is as an encoding of a particular register. In SLEIGH this
can be done with the <span class="bold"><strong>attach variables</strong></span>
statement:
</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
attach variables <span class="bold"><strong>fieldlist registerlist</strong></span>;
</pre></div>
<p>
A <span class="emphasis"><em>fieldlist</em></span> can be a single field identifier or a
space separated list of field identifiers surrounded by square
brackets. A <span class="emphasis"><em>registerlist</em></span> must be a square bracket
surrounded and space separated list of register identifiers as created
with <span class="bold"><strong>define</strong></span> statements (see Section
<a class="xref" href="sleigh_definitions.html#sleigh_naming_registers" title="4.4. Naming Registers">Section 4.4, &#8220;Naming Registers&#8221;</a>). For each field in
the <span class="emphasis"><em>fieldlist</em></span>, instead of having the display and
semantic meaning of an integer, the field becomes a look-up table for
the given list of registers. The original integer interpretation is
used as the index into the list starting at zero, so a specific
instruction that has all the bits in the field equal to zero yields
the first register (a specific varnode) from the list as the meaning
of the field in the context of that instruction. Note that both the
display and semantic meaning of the field are now taken from the new
register.
</p>
<p>
A particular integer can remain unspecified by putting a &#8216;_&#8217; character
in the appropriate position of the register list or also if the length
of the register list is less than the integer. A specific integer
encoding of the field that is unspecified like this
does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> revert to the original semantic and
display meaning. Instead this encoding is flagged as an invalid form
of the instruction.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="idm140310875368784"></a>6.3.2. Attaching Other Integers</h4></div></div></div>
<p>
Sometimes a processor interprets a field as an integer but not the
integer given by the default interpretation. A different integer
interpretation of the field can be specified with
an <span class="bold"><strong>attach values</strong></span> statement.
</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
attach values <span class="bold"><strong>fieldlist integerlist</strong></span>;
</pre></div>
<p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>integerlist</em></span> is surrounded by square brackets
and is a space separated list of integers. In the same way that a new
register interpretation is assigned to fields with
an <span class="bold"><strong>attach variables</strong></span> statement, the
integers in the list are assigned to each field specified in
the <span class="emphasis"><em>fieldlist</em></span>. [Currently SLEIGH does not support
unspecified positions in the list using a &#8216;_&#8217;]
</p>

<div class="sect3">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="idm140310875363504"></a>6.3.3. Attaching Names</h4></div></div></div>
<p>
It is possible to just modify the display characteristics of a field
without changing the semantic meaning. The need for this is rare, but
it is possible to treat a field as having influence on the display of
the disassembly but having no influence on the semantics. Even if the
bits of the field do have some semantic meaning, sometimes it is
appropriate to define overlapping fields, one of which is defined to
have no semantic meaning. The most convenient way to break down the
required disassembly may not be the most convenient way to break down
the semantics. It is also possible to have symbols with semantic
meaning but no display meaning (see <a class="xref" href="sleigh_constructors.html#sleigh_invisible_operands" title="7.4.5. Invisible Operands">Section 7.4.5, &#8220;Invisible Operands&#8221;</a>).
</p>
<p>
At any rate we can list the display interpretation of a field directly
with an <span class="bold"><strong>attach names</strong></span> statement.
</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
attach names <span class="bold"><strong>fieldlist stringlist</strong></span>;
</pre></div>
<p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>stringlist</em></span> is assigned to each of the fields
in the same manner as the <span class="bold"><strong>attach
variables</strong></span> and <span class="bold"><strong>attach
values</strong></span> statements. A specific encoding of the field now
displays as the string in the list at that integer position. Field
values greater than the size of the list are interpreted as invalid
encodings.
</p>

<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="sleigh_context_variables"></a>6.4. Context Variables</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
SLEIGH supports the concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>context
variables</em></span>. For the most part processor instructions can be
unambiguously decoded by examining only the bits of the instruction
encoding. But in some cases, decoding may depend on the state of
processor. Typically, the processor will have some set of status flags
that indicate what mode is being used to process instructions. In
terms of SLEIGH, a context variable is a <span class="emphasis"><em>field</em></span>
which is defined on top of a register rather than the instruction
encoding (token).
</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
define context <span class="bold"><strong>contextreg</strong></span>
  <span class="bold"><strong>fieldname</strong></span>=(<span class="bold"><strong>integer</strong></span>,<span class="bold"><strong>integer</strong></span>) <span class="bold"><strong>attributelist</strong></span>
  <span class="weak">...</span>
;
</pre></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Context variables are defined with a <span class="bold"><strong>define
context</strong></span> statement. The keywords must be followed by the
name of a defined register. The remaining part of the definition is
nearly identical to the normal definition of fields. Each context
variable defined on this register is listed in turn, specifying the
name, the bit range, and any attributes. All the normal field attributes,
<span class="bold"><strong>signed</strong></span>, <span class="bold"><strong>dec</strong></span>, and
<span class="bold"><strong>hex</strong></span>, can also be used for context variables.
</p>
<p>
Context variables introduce a new, dedicated, attribute: <span class="bold"><strong>noflow</strong></span>.
By default, globally setting a context variable affects instruction decoding
from the point of the change, forward,
following the flow of the instructions, but if the variable is labeled as
<span class="bold"><strong>noflow</strong></span>, any change is limited to a
single instruction. (See <a class="xref" href="sleigh_context.html#sleigh_contextflow" title="8.3.1. Context Flow">Section 8.3.1, &#8220;Context Flow&#8221;</a>)
</p>
<p>
Once the context variable is defined, in terms of the specification
syntax, it can be treated as if it were just another field. See
<a class="xref" href="sleigh_context.html" title="8. Using Context">Section 8, &#8220;Using Context&#8221;</a>, for a complete discussion of how to
use context variables.
