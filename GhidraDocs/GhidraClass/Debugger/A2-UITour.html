<h1>A Tour of the Debugger</h1>
<p>This module assumes you have completed the <a
href="A1-GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> module. If not, please
go back.</p>
<p>This module will briefly introduce each window in the Ghidra
Debugger. We assume some familiarity with trap-and-trace debugging. If
you have not used GDB or a similar debugger before, you may find the
Ghidra Debugger difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>If you would like your tool to look more or less like the one
presented in the screenshot here, launch <code>termmines</code> from the
Debugger using GDB.</p>
<section id="the-debugger-tool" class="level2">
<h2>The Debugger Tool</h2>
<p>Like the CodeBrowser tool, the Debugger tool is a preconfigured
collection of plugins and panels that present Ghidra’s dynamic analysis
features. You may re-configure, save, export, import, etc. the tool to
fit your preferences. For reference, here is a screenshot of the default
configuration after launching <code>termmines</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/GettingStarted_DisassemblyAfterLaunch.png"
alt="Debugger tool after launching termmines" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Debugger tool after launching
termmines</figcaption>
</figure>
<section id="toolbar" class="level3">
<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<p>Many of the buttons in the global toolbar are the same as in the
CodeBrowser. Coincidentally, in the screenshot, the debugger-specific
buttons start just above the Dynamic Listing in the global toolbar. They
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="images/debugger.png" alt="launch button" />
<strong>Launch</strong>: This launches the current program (from the
Static Listing) using a suitable back-end debugger. The drop-down menu
provides a selection of previously-used launchers and a sub-menu of all
available launchers. Clicking the button will use the most recent
configuration, whether or not it succeeded.</li>
<li><img src="images/process.png" alt="emulate button" />
<strong>Emulate</strong>: To be covered in a later module. This will
load the current program (from the Static Listing) into the
emulator.</li>
<li><img src="images/record.png" alt="mode button" /> <strong>Control
Mode</strong>: This drop-down menu sets the mode of the controls and
machine state edits. By default, all actions are directed to the
back-end debugger.</li>
<li><img src="images/resume.png" alt="resume button" />
<strong>Resume</strong>: Resume execution. This is equivalent to
<code>continue</code> in GDB.</li>
<li><img src="images/interrupt.png" alt="interrupt button" />
<strong>Interrupt</strong>: Interrupt, suspend, pause, break, etc. This
is equivalent to <strong><code>CTRL</code>-<code>C</code></strong> or
<code>interrupt</code> in GDB.</li>
<li><img src="images/kill.png" alt="kill button" />
<strong>Kill</strong>: Kill, terminate, etc. This is equivalent to
<code>kill</code> in GDB.</li>
<li><img src="images/disconnect.png" alt="disconnect button" />
<strong>Disconnect</strong>: Disconnect from the back-end debugger.
Typically, this will also end the session. It is equivalent to
<code>quit</code> in GDB.</li>
<li><img src="images/stepinto.png" alt="step into button" />
<strong>Step Into</strong>, <img src="images/stepover.png"
alt="step over button" /> <strong>Step Over</strong>, <img
src="images/stepout.png" alt="step out button" /> <strong>Step
Out</strong>, <img src="images/steplast.png" alt="step last button" />
<strong>Step [Extended]</strong>: These buttons step in various ways. In
order, the equivalent commands in GDB are <code>stepi</code>,
<code>nexti</code>, and <code>finish</code>. Step [Extended] represents
additional step commands supported by the back end. GDB provides
<strong>Advance</strong> and <strong>Return</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="windows" class="level3">
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Starting at the top left and working clockwise, the windows are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Debug Console</strong> window: (Not to be confused with
the CodeBrowser’s Console window.) This lists problems, diagnostics,
progress, and recommendations throughout the tool. Some problems are
presented with remedial actions, which may expedite your workflow or aid
in troubleshooting.</li>
<li>The <strong>Connections</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Debug Console. This lists active sessions or connections. From here, you
can establish new sessions or terminate existing sessions.</li>
<li>The <strong>Dynamic Listing</strong> window: This is the primary
means of examining the instructions being executed. By default, it
follows the program counter and disassembles from there until the next
control transfer instruction. It supports many of the same operations as
the Static Listing, including patching. The nearest equivalent in GDB is
something like <code>x/10i $pc</code>. The tabs at the top list the
active traces. Traces with a <img src="images/record.png"
alt="record" /> icon represent live targets. The nearest equivalent to
the tabs in GDB is <code>info inferiors</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Breakpoints</strong> window: This is on the right. It
lists and manages the breakpoints among all open program databases and
running targets. The nearest equivalent in GDB is
<code>info break</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Registers</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Breakpoints window. It displays and edits the register values for the
current thread. The nearest equivalent in GDB is
<code>info registers</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Memory</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Breakpoints window. It displays the raw bytes of memory from the current
trace or target. It supports many of the same operations as the
CodeBrowser’s Bytes window, including patching.</li>
<li>The <strong>Decompiler</strong> window: While not a dynamic analysis
window, it bears mentioning how this operates with the Debugger. It is
stacked below the Breakpoints window, more or less in the same place as
in the CodeBrowser. The Dynamic listing strives to synchronize Ghidra’s
static analysis windows with the dynamic target. So long as the correct
program database is imported and mapped at the program counter, this
window should display decompilation of the function containing it.</li>
<li>The <strong>Modules</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Registers window. It displays the images (and sections, if applicable)
loaded by the target. The equivalent in GDB is
<code>maintenance info sections</code>. Note that this differs from the
Regions window.</li>
<li>The <strong>Terminal</strong> window: This is on the bottom right.
This is a terminal emulator providing a command-line interface to the
back-end debugger and/or target I/O. It is useful for diagnostics or for
issuing commands that do not have a button in the GUI. Some may also
prefer to command the debugger from here rather than the GUI. In some
configurations, the target may have its own Terminal, separate from the
back-end debugger’s.</li>
<li>The <strong>Threads</strong> window: This is stacked below the
Terminal window. It lists the threads in the current target. The nearest
equivalent in GDB is <code>info threads</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Time</strong> window: This is stacked below the Terminal
window. This lists the events and snapshots taken of the current
target.</li>
<li>The <strong>Static Mappings</strong> window: This is stacked below
the Terminal window. It lists mappings from the current trace (dynamic
address ranges) to program databases (static address ranges). Generally,
this list is populated automatically, but may still be useful for
diagnostics or manual mapping.</li>
<li>The <strong>Stack</strong> window: This is on the bottom left. It
lists the stack frames for the current thread. The equivalent in GDB is
<code>backtrace</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Watches</strong> window: This is stacked below the Stack
window — pun not intended. It manages current watches. These are
<em>not</em> watchpoints, but rather expressions or variables whose
values you wish to display. To manage watchpoints, use the Breakpoints
window or the Terminal. The nearest equivalent in GDB is
<code>display</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Regions</strong> window: This is stacked below the Stack
window. It lists memory regions for the current target. It differs from
the Modules window, since this includes not only image-backed regions
but other memory regions, e.g., stacks and heaps. The equivalent in GDB
is <code>info proc mappings</code>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Model</strong> window: The back-end debugger populates
an object model in the trace database. It is from this model that many
other windows derive their contents: Threads, Modules, Regions, etc.
This window presents that model and provides access to generic actions
on the contained objects. It is generally more capable, though less
integrated, than the other parts of the GUI, but not quite as capable as
the Terminal. For some advanced use cases, where Ghidra does not yet
provide built-in actions, it is essential.</li>
</ul>

<section id="controlling-the-target" class="level2">
<h2>Controlling the Target</h2>
<p>The control buttons are all located on the global toolbar. Start by
pressing the <img src="images/stepinto.png" alt="step into" />
<strong>Step Into</strong> button. Notice that the Dynamic Listing moves
forward a single instruction each time you press it. Also notice that
the Static Listing moves with the Dynamic Listing. You may navigate in
either listing, and so long as there is a corresponding location in the
other, the two will stay synchronized. You may also open the Decompiler
just as you would in the CodeBrowser, and it will stay in sync too.
<strong>TIP</strong>: If you get lost in memory, you can seek back to
the program counter by double-clicking “pc = …” in the top right of the
listing.</p>
<p>When you have clicked <img src="images/stepinto.png"
alt="step into" /> <strong>Step Into</strong> a sufficient number of
times, you should end up in a subroutine. You can click <img
src="images/stepout.png" alt="step out" /> <strong>Step Out</strong> to
leave the subroutine. Note that the target is allowed to execute until
it returns from the subroutine; it does not skip out of it. Now, click
<img src="images/stepover.png" alt="step over" /> <strong>Step
Over</strong> until you reach another <code>CALL</code> instruction.
Notice that when you click <img src="images/stepover.png"
alt="step over" /> <strong>Step Over</strong> again, it will not descend
into the subroutine. Instead, the target is allowed to execute the
entire subroutine before stopping again — after the <code>CALL</code>
instruction.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you may use the GDB commands from the Terminal instead
of the buttons. Try <code>si</code> and/or <code>ni</code>. You can also
pass arguments which is not possible with the buttons,
e.g. <code>si 10</code> to step 10 instructions in one command.</p>
<p>If you need to terminate the target you should use the <img
src="images/disconnect.png" alt="disconnect" />
<strong>Disconnect</strong> button rather than the <strong>Kill</strong>
button, in general. Otherwise, each launch will create a new connection,
and you will end up with several stale connections. Additionally, if
your target exits or otherwise terminates on its own, you will get a
stale connection. Use the Connections window to clean such connections
up, or just type <code>quit</code> into the session’s Terminal. The
re-use of connections and/or the use of multiple concurrent connections
is <em>not</em> covered in this course.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<section
id="the-listings-are-not-in-sync-i.e.-they-do-not-move-together."
class="level3">
<h3>The listings are not in sync, i.e., they do not move together.</h3>
<p>First, check that synchronization is enabled. This is the default
behavior, but, still, check it first. In the top-right of the Dynamic
Listing is its local drop-down menu. Click it and check that
<strong>Auto-Sync Cursor with Static Listing</strong> is selected.</p>
<p>If that does not work, check the top-left label of the Dynamic
Listing to see what module you are in. Also check the Debug Console
window. If you are in a system library, e.g., <code>ld-linux</code>,
then this is the expected behavior. You may optionally import it, as
suggested by the Debug Console, but this is covered later. You may also
try typing into the Terminal, <em>one command at a time</em>, checking
for errors after each:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode gdb"><code class="sourceCode gdbsyntax"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">break</span> main</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>continue</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That should get you from the system entry into the target’s
<code>main</code> routine, assuming it has one. Next time you launch,
check the configuration and change <strong>Run Command</strong> to
“start”, not “starti”.</p>
<p>If you are not in a system library, then check the Modules window to
see if <code>termmines</code> is listed. If so, it seems the module
mapper failed to realize that module is the current program. Right-click
the module and select <strong>Map to termmines</strong>. Confirm the
dialog. If <code>termmines</code> is not listed, then your version of
GDB may not be supported. If you file a bug report, please include your
GDB version, Linux distribution, and/or other platform details.</p>
</section>
<section
id="the-listings-seem-to-move-together-but-their-contents-differ."
class="level3">
<h3>The listings seem to move together, but their contents differ.</h3>
<p>There is probably a discrepancy between the version you imported and
the version you launched. This should not happen with
<code>termmines</code>, but perhaps you re-ran <code>make</code> between
importing and launching? For other system libraries, this could happen
if you or an administrator applied system updates since you imported.
You probably need to re-import the affected module image(s). If this
happens to you in practice, and you have substantial investment in the
old program database, consider using the Version Tracker to port your
knowledge to the new database.</p>
</section>
<section id="there-is-no-step-button." class="level3">
<h3>There is no step button.</h3>
<p>This can happen if the Control Mode is set to <strong>Control
Trace</strong>. Perhaps you played with the Time window? The Control
Mode drop-down is leftmost in the “Control” group, immediately right of
the <strong>Launch</strong> and <strong>Emulate</strong> buttons. Its
icon differs for each mode. Change it back to <strong>Control
Target</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section
id="i-can-step-but-i-dont-see-the-effects-in-the-terminal-window."
class="level3">
<h3>I can step, but I don’t see the effects in the Terminal window.</h3>
<p>This can happen if the Control Mode is set to <strong>Control
Emulator</strong>. See the above heading about Control Mode. Change it
back to <strong>Control Target</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-step-buttons-are-grayed-out." class="level3">
<h3>The Step buttons are grayed out.</h3>
<p>The target has likely terminated, or you have not selected a thread.
Check the Threads window or the Model window. If it is empty, re-launch,
and perhaps look at the Troubleshooting section in <a
href="A1-GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="exercise-step-around" class="level2">
<h2>Exercise: Step Around</h2>
<p>If you were not already following along with an instructor, then try
some of the stepping buttons. One of the first subroutines called in
<code>termmines</code> parses command-line arguments. Try stepping until
you have entered that subroutine. <strong>TIP</strong>: Use the
Decompiler to help you recognize when you have entered the command-line
parsing subroutine. Alternatively, use the Static Listing and Decompiler
to identify the parsing subroutine (as you would in the CodeBrowser),
and then use the <strong>Step</strong> buttons to drive the target into
it.</p>
