<h1>Using Breakpoints</h1>
<p>This module assumes you know how to launch <code>termmines</code> in
Ghidra using GDB and know where to find the basic Debugger GUI
components. If not, please refer to the previous modules.</p>
<p>This module will address the Breakpoints window in more depth. While
the breakpoint manager is able to deal with a system of targets, we will
only deal with a single target at a time.</p>
<section id="breakpoints" class="level2">
<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
<p>Most likely, this window is empty if you have been following the
lesson.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Breakpoints_EmptyAfterLaunch.png"
alt="The breakpoints window" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The breakpoints window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From here, you can toggle and delete existing breakpoints. There are
several ways to set a new breakpoint:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From any static or dynamic listing window, including Disassembly,
Memory/Hex, and the Decompiler, right-click and select <img
src="images/breakpoint-enable.png" alt="set breakpoint" /> Set
Breakpoint, press <strong><code>K</code></strong> on the keyboard, or
double-click the margin.</li>
<li>From the Breakpoints window, use the <strong>Set Breakpoint</strong>
dropdown to to access the various breakpoint actions defined by
GDB.</li>
<li>From the Terminal window, use the GDB command, e.g.,
<code>break main</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The advantage of using the listings is that you can quickly set a
breakpoint at any address. The advantage of using the dropdown action or
Terminal window is that you can specify something other than an address.
Often, those specifications still resolve to addresses, and Ghidra will
display them. Ghidra will memorize breakpoints by recording them as
special bookmarks in the program database. There is some iconography to
communicate the various states of a breakpoint. When all is well and
normal, you should only see enabled <img
src="images/breakpoint-enable.png" alt="enabled breakpoint" /> and
disabled <img src="images/breakpoint-disable.png"
alt="disabled breakpoint" /> breakpoints. If the target is terminated
(or not launched yet), you may also see ineffective <img
src="images/breakpoint-enable-ineff.png" alt="ineffective breakpoint" />
breakpoints.</p>
</section>
<section id="examining-minesweeper-board-setup" class="level2">
<h2>Examining Minesweeper Board Setup</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to cheat at <code>termmines</code>. We might like to
understand how the mines are placed. Knowing that the mines are placed
randomly, we might hypothesize that it is using the <code>srand</code>
and <code>rand</code> functions from the C standard library. While we
can test that hypothesis by examining the imports statically, we might
also like to record some actual values, so we will approach this
dynamically. (This is the Debugger course, after all.) The breakpoint on
<code>srand</code> will allow us to capture the random seed. The
breakpoint on <code>rand</code> will help us find the algorithm that
places the mines.</p>
<section id="set-the-breakpoints" class="level3">
<h3>Set the Breakpoints</h3>
<p>In the Terminal, type the GDB commands to set breakpoints on
<code>srand</code> and <code>rand</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode gdb"><code class="sourceCode gdbsyntax"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">break</span> srand</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">break</span> rand</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The breakpoint window should now be updated:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Breakpoints_PopAfterSRandRand.png"
alt="Populated breakpoints window" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Populated breakpoints window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For a single target, the lower panel of the Breakpoints window does
not add much information, but it does have some. We will start with the
top panel. This lists the <em>logical</em> breakpoints, preferring
static addresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The left-most column <strong>State</strong> indicates the
breakpoint’s state. Here, we see the inconsistent <img
src="images/breakpoint-overlay-inconsistent.png" alt="inconsistent" />
overlay, because Ghidra cannot save the breakpoint without a program
database. That is because <code>srand</code> and <code>rand</code> are
in a different module, and we have not yet imported it into Ghidra.</li>
<li>The next column <strong>Name</strong> is the name of the breakpoint.
This is for informational purposes only. You can rename a breakpoint
however you like, and it will have no effect on the target nor back-end
debugger.</li>
<li>The next column <strong>Address</strong> gives the address of the
breakpoint. Notice that the addresses were resolved, even though the
breakpoints were specified by symbol. Typically, this is the
<em>static</em> address of the breakpoint; however, if the module image
is not imported, yet, this will be the <em>dynamic</em> address, subject
to relocation or ASLR.</li>
<li>The next column <strong>Image</strong> gives the name of the program
database containing the breakpoint. Again, because the module has not
been imported yet, this column is blank.</li>
<li>The next column <strong>Length</strong> gives the length of the
breakpoint. In GDB, this generally applies to watchpoints only.</li>
<li>The next column <strong>Kinds</strong> gives the kinds of
breakpoint. Most breakpoints are software execution breakpoints,
indicated by “SW_EXECUTE.” That is, they are implemented by patching the
target’s memory with a special instruction that traps execution —
<code>INT3</code> on x86. There are also hardware execution breakpoints
indicated by “HW_EXECUTE,” and access breakpoints indicated by “HW_READ”
and/or “HW_WRITE”. <strong>NOTE</strong>: GDB would call access
breakpoints <em>watchpoints</em>. An advantage to software breakpoints
is that you can have a practically unlimited number of them. Some
disadvantages are they can be detected easily, and they are limited to
execution breakpoints.</li>
<li>The next column <strong>Locations</strong> counts the number of
locations for the breakpoint. For a single-target session, this is most
likely 1.</li>
<li>The final column <strong>Sleigh</strong> is only applicable to the
emulator. It indicates that the breakpoint’s behavior has been
customized with Sleigh code. This is covered in <a
href="B2-Emulation.html">Emulation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we move to the bottom panel. This lists the breakpoint
locations, as reported by the back-end debugger(s). The State, Address,
and Sleigh columns are the same as the top, but for the individual
<em>dynamic</em> addresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Name</strong> column is the name as designated by the
back-end.</li>
<li>The <strong>Trace</strong> column indicates which target contains
the location. The text here should match one of the tabs from the
Dynamic Listing panel.</li>
<li>The <strong>Comment</strong> column is a user-defined comment. Its
default value is the specification that generated it, e.g.,
<code>srand</code>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="toggling-the-breakpoints" class="level3">
<h3>Toggling the Breakpoints</h3>
<p>While there is no need to toggle the breakpoints right now, it is a
good time to demonstrate the feature. There are several ways to toggle a
breakpoint:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In any listing, as in setting a breakpoint, right-click and select a
toggle action, press <strong><code>K</code></strong> on the keyboard, or
double-click its icon in the margin.</li>
<li>From the Model window, expand the <em>Breakpoints</em> node and
double-click a breakpoint, or select one with the keyboard and press
<strong><code>ENTER</code></strong>. For GDB, this must be done from the
top-level <em>Breakpoints</em> node, not the one subordinate to the
<em>inferior</em>.</li>
<li>From the Breakpoints window, single-click the breakpoint’s status
icon, right-click an entry and select a toggle action, or create a
selection and use a toggling action from the local toolbar. Either panel
works, but the top panel is preferred to keep the breakpoints
consistent. The local toolbar also has actions for toggling all
breakpoints in the session.</li>
<li>From the Terminal window, use the GDB commands, e.g.,
<code>disable 2</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Practice toggling them. Notice that no matter how you toggle the
breakpoints, the display updates. You might also type
<code>info break</code> into the Terminal to confirm the effect of
toggling breakpoints in the GUI. When you are finished, ensure both
breakpoints are enabled.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In all parts of the GUI, except the Model
window, Ghidra prefers to toggle breakpoint locations. Without getting
into details, this is the second level down of breakpoints shown in the
Model tree. If you set a breakpoint, and GDB calls this breakpoint 2,
then you toggle it in the listing, Ghidra will toggle, e.g., breakpoint
<em>location</em> 2.1, not the breakpoint <em>specification</em> 2. If
you disable breakpoint 2 using the Model or Terminal window, it may
become impossible to toggle the breakpoint in the Listing or Breakpoints
windows. If you find your session in this condition, just re-enable the
troublesome breakpoints in the Model or Terminal window.</p>
</section>
<section id="importing-libc" class="level3">
<h3>Importing <code>libc</code></h3>
<p>While the Debugger can operate without importing external modules, it
generally works better when you have. The symbols <code>srand</code> and
<code>rand</code> are in <code>libc</code>. If you would like to save
the breakpoints we placed on them, you must import the module. You could
do this in the usual manner, but the Debugger offers a convenient way to
import missing modules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to a dynamic address that would be mapped to the missing
module. For our scenario, the easiest way to do that is to double-click
an address in the Breakpoints window. Either one points somewhere in
<code>libc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the Debug Console window for a note about the missing
module:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Breakpoints_MissingModuleNote.png"
alt="Missing module note in the debug console" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Missing module note in the debug
console</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li><p>Click the import button — leftmost of the remedial actions. It
will display a file browser pointed at the library file.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed with the import and initial analysis as you would in the
CodeBrowser.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once imported, the Breakpoints window should update to reflect the
static addresses, the breakpoints should become consistent, and the
Static Listing should now be synchronized when navigating within
<code>libc</code>. <strong>NOTE</strong>: Ghidra has not automatically
disassembled the dynamic listing, because the program counter has not
actually landed there, yet.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Breakpoints_SyncedAfterImportLibC.png"
alt="The debugger tool with breakpoints synchronized after importing libc" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The debugger tool with breakpoints
synchronized after importing libc</figcaption>
</figure>
<section id="troubleshooting" class="level4">
<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>If it seems nothing has changed, except now you have a second program
database open, then the new module may not be successfully mapped. Try
one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Re-check the Debug Console window and verify the note has been
removed.</li>
<li>If not, it might be because the module is symlinked in the file
system, so the name of the module and the name of the program database
do not match.</li>
<li>Ensure that <code>libc</code> is the current program (tab) in the
Static Listing.</li>
<li>Wait for auto-analysis of <code>libc</code> to complete. Yeah, it
may take a moment, but auto-mapping is queued as a background task, and
so it cannot map things until auto-analysis is done.</li>
<li>In the Modules window, right-click on <code>libc</code>, and select
<strong>Map Module to libc</strong>. (Names and titles will likely
differ.)</li>
</ol>
</section>
</section>
<section id="capturing-the-random-seed" class="level3">
<h3>Capturing the Random Seed</h3>
<p>We can now allow <code>termmines</code> to execute, expecting it to
hit the <code>srand</code> breakpoint first. Click <img
src="images/resume.png" alt="resume" /> Resume. If all goes well, the
target should break at <code>srand</code>. If you have never written
code that uses <code>srand</code> before, you should briefly read its
manual page. It takes a single parameter, the desired seed. That
parameter contains the seed this very moment! We can then examine the
value of the seed by hovering over <code>param_1</code> in the
decompiler.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/Breakpoints_SeedValueAfterBreakSRand.png"
alt="Seed value in decompiler hover" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Seed value in decompiler
hover</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We will cover other ways to examine memory and registers in the <a
href="A4-MachineState.html">Machine State</a> module. We have contrived
<code>termmines</code> so that its random seed will always start with
<code>0x5eed____</code>. If you see that in the value displayed, then
you have successfully recovered the seed. This seed will be used in an
optional exercise at the end of this module. You might write it down;
however, if you re-launch <code>termmines</code> between now and then,
you will have a different seed.</p>
</section>
<section id="locating-the-mine-placement-algorithm" class="level3">
<h3>Locating the Mine Placement Algorithm</h3>
<p>Press <img src="images/resume.png" alt="resume" /> Resume again. This
time, the target should break at <code>rand</code>. We are not
interested in the <code>rand</code> function itself, but rather how the
placement algorithm is using it. Press <img src="images/stepout.png"
alt="step out" /> Step Out to allow the target to return from
<code>rand</code>. If you still have the Decompiler up, you should be in
a code block resembling:</p>

<p>If you are thinking, “I could have just found <code>rand</code> in
the symbol table and followed its XRefs,” you are correct. However, it
is useful to use a dynamic debugging session to drive your analysis
chronologically through execution of the target, even if much of that
analysis is still static. The advantages of a dynamic session along side
static analysis should become more apparent as you progress through this
course.</p>
</section>
<section id="exercise-diagram-the-mines" class="level3">
<h3>Exercise: Diagram the Mines</h3>
<p>You goal is to capture the location of all the mines. You will
probably want to disable the breakpoints on <code>rand</code> and
<code>srand</code> for now. Devise a strategy using breakpoints and the
control buttons (Step, Resume, etc.) so that you can observe the
location of each mine. Use pen and paper to draw a diagram of the board,
and mark the location of each mine as you observe the algorithm placing
it. There should only be 10 mines in Beginner mode. Once the mines are
placed, press <img src="images/resume.png" alt="resume" /> Resume. Check
you work by winning the game. Alternatively, you can intentionally lose
to have the game reveal the mines.</p>
<section id="troubleshooting-1" class="level4">
<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>You may find that running both GDB and <code>termmines</code> in the
same Terminal makes viewing the game board difficult. The next time you
launch, be sure to use the <strong>Configure and Launch</strong>
sub-menu, then enable the <strong>Inferior TTY</strong> option. This
should start two Terminals, one with GDB and a second dedicated to
<code>termmines</code>. The game board will no longer be corrupted by
GDB’s prompts and diagnostics. You will probably want to undock the
<code>termmines</code> Terminal and resize it to fit the board.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="optional-exercise-replicate-the-boards-forward-engineering"
class="level3">
<h3>Optional Exercise: Replicate the Boards (Forward Engineering)</h3>
<p>You will need a C development environment for this exercise. Because,
as we have now confirmed, <code>termmines</code> is importing its random
number generator from the system, we can write a program that uses that
same generator. Further, because we can capture the seed, and we know
the placement algorithm, we can perfectly replicate the sequence of game
boards for any <code>termmines</code> session.</p>
<p>Write a program that takes a seed from the user and prints a diagram
of the first game board with the mines indicated. Optionally, have it
