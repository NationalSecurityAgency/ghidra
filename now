## Review

 We welcome code reviews from anyone. A committer is required to formally
  accept and merge the changes.
- Reviewers will be looking for things like threading issues, performance
  implications, API design, duplication of existing functionality, readability
  and code style, avoidance of bloat (scope-creep), etc.
- Reviewers will likely ask questions to better understand your change.
- Reviewers will make comments about changes to your patch:
    - MUST means that the change is required
    - SHOULD means that the change is suggested, further discussion on the
      subject may be required
    - COULD means that the change is optional
