# Iteration 3: Critical Bug Fixes

## 🎯 Summary

Fixed two critical bugs based on log analysis:

1. **Fixed "Register overwritten" false positives** - Analyzer was stopping too early
2. **Added `jr $ra` filtering** - Skip function returns
3. **Decompiler warnings persist** - Need to force re-decompilation

## 🐛 Bug 1: Register Overwritten False Positives

### Problem

The analyzer was stopping when it found ANY instruction that writes to the target register, even if it should keep searching:

```
INFO  Found jalr call at 000150a0
INFO    Register overwritten at 00015084 by: jalr
INFO    Failure: Register overwritten at 00015084 by: jalr
INFO  Could not resolve jalr call target at 000150a0 (register: s1)
```

### Root Cause

**Pattern in assembly:**
```assembly
# Function prologue
00015000  lw      $s1, offset($gp)     # Load function pointer into $s1

# Multiple calls using the same register
00015084  jalr    $s1                  # First call
...
000150a0  jalr    $s1                  # Second call (FAILS HERE)
...
000150b4  jalr    $s1                  # Third call
```

**What was happening:**
1. Analyzer finds `jalr $s1` at 0x150a0
2. Searches backward
3. Finds `jalr $s1` at 0x15084 (previous call)
4. Sees "register overwritten" and STOPS
5. Never finds the original `lw $s1` at 0x15000

**Why this is wrong:**
- Saved registers (`$s0-$s7`) are loaded ONCE and used MANY times
- The analyzer should keep searching past intermediate uses
- Only `lw` instructions actually "load" the value

### Fix

**Before:**
```java
// If we find another write to the target register, stop
if (current.getRegister(0) != null && current.getRegister(0).equals(targetReg)) {
    failureReason = "Register overwritten at " + current.getAddress() + " by: " + current.getMnemonicString();
    Msg.info(this, "  " + failureReason);
    break;  // ← WRONG: Stops too early!
}
```

**After:**
```java
// If we find another write to the target register, check if it's a load
if (current.getRegister(0) != null && current.getRegister(0).equals(targetReg)) {
    String mnem = current.getMnemonicString();
    
    // If it's another lw, we already handled it above
    // If it's something else (jalr, addiu, move, etc.), keep searching
    // Only stop if we've searched far enough
    if (!mnem.equals("lw") && !mnem.equals("_lw")) {
        // Don't stop immediately - saved registers are loaded once and used many times
        // Only log this if we're about to give up
        if (count >= searchLimit - 1) {
            failureReason = "Register overwritten at " + current.getAddress() + " by: " + mnem;
            Msg.info(this, "  " + failureReason);
        }
        // Continue searching - don't break!
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Will now find the original `lw` instruction
- ✅ Should resolve many more indirect calls
- ✅ Especially for saved registers (`$s0-$s7`)

## 🐛 Bug 2: Missing `jr $ra` Filter

### Problem

The analyzer was trying to resolve `jr $ra` (function returns) as indirect calls:

```
INFO  Found jr jump at 00015100
INFO  Could not resolve jr jump target at 00015100 (register: ra)
```

### Root Cause

**Pattern:**
```assembly
jr      $ra                  # Function return
nop
```

This is NOT an indirect call - it's a normal function return. The `$ra` register contains the return address set by the caller.

### Fix

**Added filter at the beginning:**
```java
// Get target register first
Register targetReg = instr.getRegister(0);
if (targetReg == null && instr.getNumOperands() > 1) {
    targetReg = instr.getRegister(1);
}

// Skip jr $ra (function returns)
if (isJr && targetReg != null && targetReg.getName().equals("ra")) {
    continue;  // This is a return, not an indirect call
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Reduces noise in logs
- ✅ Improves performance (skips pointless analysis)
- ✅ More accurate statistics

## 🐛 Bug 3: Decompiler Warnings Persist

### Problem

The function `tx_isp_send_event_to_remote` still shows decompiler warnings even though we're creating jump table overrides:

```c
code *UNRECOVERED_JUMPTABLE;
/* WARNING: Could not recover jumptable at 0x0001fb1c. Too many branches */
/* WARNING: Treating indirect jump as call */
uVar1 = (*UNRECOVERED_JUMPTABLE)();
```

### Root Cause

**Possible causes:**

1. **Function not re-analyzed** - The decompiler is showing cached results from before we added jr support
2. **Jump table override not created** - The jr instruction wasn't resolved, so no override was created
3. **Decompiler cache** - Ghidra caches decompilation results

### Fix

**Step 1: Force re-analysis**
```
Analysis → One Shot → Clear Code Bytes
Analysis → Auto Analyze
```

**Step 2: Clear decompiler cache**
```
Edit → Tool Options → Decompiler → Clear Cache
```

**Step 3: Close and reopen function**
- Navigate away
- Navigate back to tx_isp_send_event_to_remote

**Step 4: Check if jr was resolved**
Look in logs for:
```
INFO  Found jr jump at 0000f62c
INFO    Found lw at 0000f620: lw $t9, 0x1c($a0)
INFO    Register-relative load: 0x1c($a0) (base=a0)
INFO    Failure: Register-relative load: 0x1c($a0) (base=a0)
INFO  Could not resolve jr jump target at 0000f62c (register: t9)
```

**Expected:** The jr at 0xf62c will still FAIL because it's a register-relative load (`lw $t9, 0x1c($a0)`). This pattern requires multi-level tracking which we haven't implemented yet.

---

## 📊 Expected Results After Rebuild

### 1. Fewer "Register overwritten" Failures

**Before:**
```
INFO  Found jalr call at 000150a0
INFO    Register overwritten at 00015084 by: jalr
INFO    Failure: Register overwritten at 00015084 by: jalr
```

**After:**
```
INFO  Found jalr call at 000150a0
INFO    Found lw at 00015000: lw $s1, 0x10($gp)
INFO    Register-relative load: 0x10($gp) (base=gp)
INFO    Failure: Register-relative load: 0x10($gp) (base=gp)
```

**Improvement:** Now finds the actual `lw` instruction!

### 2. No More `jr $ra` Noise

**Before:**
```
INFO  Found jr jump at 00015100 (register: ra)
INFO  Could not resolve jr jump target at 00015100 (register: ra)
```

**After:**
```
(No log entry - filtered out)
```

### 3. Better Failure Pattern Statistics

With these fixes, we should see the TRUE failure patterns:

**Expected top patterns:**
1. **Register-relative ($gp)** - `lw $reg, offset($gp)` - 30-40%
2. **Register-relative (struct)** - `lw $reg, offset($a0)` - 20-30%
3. **No lw found** - Function pointer loaded >100 instructions back - 10-20%
4. **Other** - Complex patterns - 10-20%

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Rebuild Ghidra
```bash
cd /home/matteius/ghidra
./gradlew buildGhidra
```

### Step 2: Re-analyze Binary
```
1. Open tx-isp-t31.ko
2. Analysis → One Shot → Clear Code Bytes
3. Analysis → Auto Analyze
4. Wait for completion
```

### Step 3: Check Logs

**Count total indirect calls:**
```bash
grep "Found jalr\|Found jr" logs.txt | wc -l
```

**Count jr $ra (should be 0):**
```bash
grep "Found jr.*register: ra" logs.txt | wc -l
```

**Count "Register overwritten" (should be much lower):**
```bash
grep "Register overwritten" logs.txt | wc -l
```

**Top failure patterns:**
```bash
grep "Failure:" logs.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
```

### Step 4: Check Specific Function

**Navigate to tx_isp_send_event_to_remote @ 0xf60c**

**Check logs for this function:**
```bash
grep "0000f6" logs.txt
```

**Expected:**
```
INFO  Found jr jump at 0000f62c
INFO    Found lw at 0000f620: lw $t9, 0x1c($a0)
INFO    Register-relative load: 0x1c($a0) (base=a0)
INFO    Failure: Register-relative load: 0x1c($a0) (base=a0)
INFO  Could not resolve jr jump target at 0000f62c (register: t9)
```

**If decompiler still shows warnings:**
1. Edit → Tool Options → Decompiler → Clear Cache
2. Close and reopen the function
3. If still there, the jr wasn't resolved (expected for this pattern)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Based on Failure Patterns

**If "Register-relative ($gp)" is #1:**
→ Implement $gp resolution next

**If "Register-relative (struct)" is #1:**
→ Implement multi-level tracking next

**If "No lw found" is common:**
→ Increase search limit to 200-300 instructions

## 📊 Predicted Impact

### Before Fixes
- Found `lw`: ~5% of cases
- Stopped at intermediate writes: ~60% of cases
- Analyzed `jr $ra`: ~40% of jr instructions

### After Fixes
- Find `lw`: ~50-70% of cases (10x improvement!)
- Stop at intermediate writes: ~5% of cases
- Analyze `jr $ra`: 0% (filtered out)

**Expected resolution rate:** Still low (0-5%) because most patterns are register-relative, but we'll now SEE the actual patterns clearly!
