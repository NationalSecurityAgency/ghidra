# Ghidra Segmented Memory Support Implementation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of comprehensive segmented memory support in Ghidra, enabling proper handling of x86 real mode and other segmented architectures.

## ✅ Phase 1: seg_next Implementation (COMPLETED)

### Problem Statement  
The core issue was in `ia.sinc` where x86 real mode segmented memory handling was broken:
```sleigh
rel16: reloc is simm16 [ reloc=((inst_next >> 16) << 16) | ((inst_next + simm16) & 0xFFFF); ]
```
This incorrectly tried to extract segment values from linear address upper bits for **all modes**. While this approach works for Ghidra's protected mode hack (where selectors are left-shifted 16 bits), it's mathematically impossible for **real mode** since multiple segment:offset combinations map to the same linear address.

### Solution: seg_next Built-in Variable
Following the pattern of existing instruction values (`inst_next`, `inst_next2`), we implemented `seg_next` across **25 files** with the following components:
- SpecificSymbol classes (SegSymbol)
- Expression classes (SegInstructionValue) 
- Symbol type enums (seg_symbol)
- Parser context methods (getSegaddr())
- SLA format constants (ELEM_SEG_EXP, ELEM_SEG_SYM, etc.)

### Implementation Details

#### Java Framework Changes (15 files)
- **Symbol Types**: Added `seg_symbol` to enums in Java and C++
- **Core Classes**: Created `SegSymbol` and `SegInstructionValue` in both framework and pcodeCPort
- **Critical Enhancement**: Enhanced `SleighParserContext.computeSegAddress()` to use real segment extraction:
```java
if (addr instanceof SegmentedAddress) {
    SegmentedAddress segAddr = (SegmentedAddress) addr;
    long segmentValue = segAddr.getSegment();  // Real CS register!
    return constantSpace.getAddress(segmentValue);
}
```
- **Infrastructure**: Updated predefined symbols, format constants, template support, decoders, grammar files, and assembler integration

#### C++ Decompiler Changes (9 files)
- **Format Constants**: Added ELEM_SEG_EXP, ELEM_SEG_SYM, ELEM_SEG_SYM_HEAD with proper ID sequencing
- **Classes**: Created C++ SegSymbol and SegInstructionValue with encode/decode support
- **Template Support**: Added ConstTpl::j_seg with fix/encode/decode methods
- **Decoders**: Added missing cases for new element types
- **Context Methods**: Added getSegaddr() to ParserContext and ParserWalker

### Target Fix Applied
Updated `ia.sinc` rel16 definition to:
```sleigh
rel16: reloc is protectedMode=0 & simm16 [ reloc=(seg_next << 4) + ((inst_next - (seg_next << 4) + simm16) & 0xFFFF); ]
rel16: reloc is protectedMode=1 & simm16 [ reloc=((inst_next >> 16) << 16) | ((inst_next + simm16) & 0xFFFF); ]
```

#### Implementation Notes: Why Different Approaches?

**Real Mode (protectedMode=0)**: Uses `seg_next` because:
- Multiple segment:offset combinations map to same linear address (segment << 4)
- Extracting segment from linear address is mathematically impossible
- Requires actual segment register value from `seg_next`

**Protected Mode (protectedMode=1)**: Uses linear address extraction because:
- Ghidra's hack creates one-to-one mapping (selector << 16) 
- Each linear address has exactly one segment:offset representation
- Segment extraction via `(inst_next >> 16) << 16` is mathematically reliable
- No need for `seg_next` - the artificial address space makes extraction feasible

### Architecture Discovery
Investigation revealed critical architecture insight:
- **Java SleighParserContext**: Used for instruction parsing/pattern matching - WHERE seg_next IS ACTUALLY EVALUATED with access to real SegmentedAddress objects
- **C++ ParserContext**: Used for p-code generation when seg_next already resolved - implementation is likely unused fallback

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All 25 files successfully implemented and compiled. Ready for testing x86 segmented memory handling where relative CALL instructions preserve CS register while only modifying IP within 64K segment boundaries.

## ✅ Phase 2: Processor-Neutral Immediate Operand Enhancement (COMPLETED)

### Problem Statement
While `seg_next` fixed instruction parsing, immediate operands like in `mov bx, 0x4f0` weren't being recognized as segmented addresses. Ghidra showed error "Address not found in program memory: 0000:04f0" instead of using the DS register to create `DS:0x4f0`.

### Solution: Processor-Neutral Segmented Address Resolution
Enhanced both `ScalarOperandAnalyzer` and `OperandFieldMouseHandler` to be segment-aware using the existing `<constresolve>` mechanism from processor specifications.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Enhanced ScalarOperandAnalyzer
- **File**: `Ghidra/Features/Base/src/main/java/ghidra/app/plugin/core/analysis/ScalarOperandAnalyzer.java`
- **Enhancement**: Added segment-aware address creation in `addReference()` method
- **Logic**: For segmented address spaces, uses processor's constresolve register to create proper segmented addresses

#### 2. Enhanced OperandFieldMouseHandler  
- **File**: `Ghidra/Features/Base/src/main/java/ghidra/app/util/viewer/field/OperandFieldMouseHandler.java`
- **Enhancement**: Modified `getAddressFromScalar()` to support segmented navigation
- **Logic**: Double-clicking on immediate operands now resolves using segment registers

#### 3. Created SegmentedAddressHelper Utility
- **File**: `Ghidra/Features/Base/src/main/java/ghidra/app/util/SegmentedAddressHelper.java`
- **Purpose**: Processor-neutral utility for segmented address resolution
- **Key Feature**: Automatically extracts `constresolve` register from processor specification

### Processor-Neutral Architecture
The implementation is truly processor-agnostic:

#### Processor Specification Integration
- **x86-16-real.pspec**: `<constresolve><register name="DS"/></constresolve>`
- **z80.pspec**: `<constresolve><register name="rBBR"/></constresolve>`
- **Future processors**: Just define the appropriate register in their `.pspec` files

#### Automatic Register Discovery
```java
// Get the constresolve register from processor specification
PcodeInjectLibrary injectLibrary = program.getCompilerSpec().getPcodeInjectLibrary();
InjectPayload segmentPayload = injectLibrary.getPayload(InjectPayload.EXECUTABLEPCODE_TYPE, "segment_pcode");

// Extract register information from InjectPayloadSegment via reflection
// No hardcoded register names - completely processor-neutral!
```

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Processor Agnostic**: Works for any segmented architecture (x86, Z80, future processors)
2. **Specification Driven**: Register information comes from `.pspec` files where it belongs
3. **No Hardcoding**: Zero hardcoded register names in generic Java code
4. **Extensible**: New segmented architectures just need to define `<constresolve>` in their specs
5. **Consistent**: Uses the same infrastructure as our `seg_next` implementation

### Expected Results
- `mov bx, 0x4f0` in x86 → Will be recognized as `DS:0x4f0` using DS register value
- Similar instructions in Z80 → Will use `rBBR` register automatically  
- Future segmented processors → Will use their specified `constresolve` register
- Double-clicking immediate operands → Navigates to proper segmented addresses

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All enhancements implemented and compiled successfully. The solution respects Ghidra's modular architecture by using the processor specification system instead of hardcoding processor-specific knowledge.

## ✅ Phase 3: Decompiler Segmented Address Navigation (COMPLETED)

### Problem Statement
While Phases 1 and 2 successfully implemented segmented memory support for the disassembler, the decompiler had its own separate mouse handling logic that wasn't segment-aware. Double-clicking on immediate operands in the decompiler would fail with messages like "Invalid address: X" where X was a decimal linear address.

### Root Cause
The decompiler's `goToScalar()` method in `DecompilerProvider.java` was creating linear addresses directly from scalar values, bypassing the segmented address resolution implemented for the disassembler.

### Solution: Unified Segmented Address Resolution
Enhanced the decompiler's `goToScalar()` method to use the same `SegmentedAddressHelper` utility that was created for the disassembler, ensuring consistent segmented memory handling across both views.

### Implementation Details

#### Enhanced DecompilerProvider.goToScalar()
- **File**: `Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/src/main/java/ghidra/app/plugin/core/decompile/DecompilerProvider.java`
- **Enhancement**: Added segment-aware address creation using `SegmentedAddressHelper`
- **New Method**: Added `createAddressFromScalar()` helper method with same logic as disassembler

#### Key Features
1. **Processor-Neutral**: Uses the same `SegmentedAddressHelper.createSegmentedAddress()` method
2. **Context-Aware**: Uses current function's entry point as context for segment register lookup
3. **Fallback Logic**: Tries function's address space first, then default space
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Matches the disassembler's operand handling exactly

### Architecture Consistency
The decompiler now uses the identical segmented address resolution as the disassembler:

#### Shared Infrastructure
- **SegmentedAddressHelper**: Single utility class used by both disassembler and decompiler
- **Processor Specification**: Both rely on `<constresolve>` register definitions
- **Context Resolution**: Both use program context to get segment register values
- **Fallback Handling**: Both gracefully handle missing segment information

### Expected Results
- Double-clicking immediate operands in decompiler → Properly navigates to segmented addresses
- Consistent behavior between disassembler and decompiler navigation
- Error messages eliminated for valid segmented addresses
- Full segmented memory support across all Ghidra views

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The decompiler now provides the same segmented address navigation capabilities as the disassembler. Both views consistently handle immediate operands using processor-neutral segment register resolution.

## ✅ Phase 3: CS Segment Override Fix for Memory Addressing (COMPLETED)

### Problem Statement  
While `seg_next` was successfully implemented for relative addressing (like `rel16`), CS segment overrides in memory addressing patterns were still broken. The specific failing pattern was:
```
131d:1518 2e 89 3e e6 11        MOV        word ptr CS:[DAT_1000_11e6],DI
```

This instruction has a CS segment override (`0x2e` prefix) but the `currentCS` pattern was still using the old broken approach of extracting segment from linear addresses.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue traced through this pattern matching chain:
1. **CS segment override prefix** (`0x2e`) sets `segover=1`
2. **MOV instruction** (`0x89`) uses `m16` memory operand  
3. **`m16` resolves** through `Mem16` pattern with `seg16`
4. **`seg16` with `segover=1`** uses `currentCS` pattern
5. **`currentCS` was still broken**: Used `(inst_next >> 4) & 0xf000` instead of `seg_next`

### Solution Applied
Updated the `currentCS` pattern definitions in `ia.sinc` to use `seg_next`:

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```sleigh
currentCS: CS is protectedMode=0 & CS { tmp:4 = (inst_next >> 4) & 0xf000; CS = tmp:2; export CS; }
currentCS: CS is protectedMode=1 & CS { tmp:4 = (inst_next >> 16) & 0xffff; CS = tmp:2; export CS; }
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```sleigh
currentCS: CS is CS { tmp:4 = seg_next; CS = tmp:2; export CS; }
```

### Technical Details
- **Pattern Chain**: CS override → MOV `m16` → `Mem16` → `seg16` → `currentCS` → now uses real segment value
- **Consistency**: This fix aligns `currentCS` with the successful `rel16` real mode pattern that uses `seg_next` (note: `rel16` protected mode uses different approach)
- **Simplification**: Since `seg_next` provides real segment values, the `protectedMode` distinction was eliminated—one pattern now handles both modes
- **Architecture**: Leverages the existing `seg_next` infrastructure implemented in Phase 1

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE
CS segment override in memory addressing now properly uses real segment values instead of attempting impossible extraction from linear addresses. This fixes the specific issue with patterns like `MOV word ptr CS:[DAT_1000_11e6],DI` where data is stored locally to the code segment.

- ✅ **All processor-neutral segmented architectures** via specification-driven design

### Validation Checklist
To verify the implementation works:
1. Load an x86 real mode binary in Ghidra
2. Navigate to instructions with immediate operands (e.g., `mov bx, 0x4f0`)
3. **Disassembler test**: Double-click immediate operand → should navigate to `DS:0x4f0`
4. **Decompiler test**: Double-click same operand in decompiler → should navigate to same segmented address
5. Verify both views show consistent navigation behavior

### Future Enhancements
Potential areas for future improvement:
- Enhanced segment register tracking during analysis
- Better visualization of segmented addresses in the UI
- Additional segmented architecture support as needed

## 16-Bit Protected Mode: Ghidra's Hack and Limitations

### Overview
While this implementation provides comprehensive support for **real mode segmentation**, 16-bit protected mode in Ghidra uses a simplified "hack" approach that has significant architectural limitations. This section documents these limitations to set proper expectations.

### Ghidra's Protected Mode Implementation
Ghidra handles 16-bit protected mode using a simplified address calculation defined in `x86-16.pspec`:
```java
// Ghidra's hack: selector << 16 + offset
res = (zext(base) << 16) + zext(inner);
```

This contrasts with **real mode** (in `x86-16-real.pspec`):
```java
// Architecturally correct: segment << 4 + offset  
res = (zext(base) << 4) + zext(inner);
```

### Architectural Limitations

#### 1. **Simplified Address Mapping**
- **Reality**: In true 16-bit protected mode, segment registers contain **selectors** that index into Global/Local Descriptor Tables (GDT/LDT) to retrieve base addresses, limits, and access rights
- **Ghidra's Hack**: Treats selectors as if they were base addresses shifted left by 16 bits
- **Impact**: `selector << 16` creates an artificial linear mapping that doesn't correspond to actual descriptor table entries

#### 2. **Missing Descriptor Table Information**
- **Reality**: Protected mode descriptors contain rich information:
  - Base address (20-bit in 286, 32-bit in 386+)
  - Segment limit (16-bit with granularity bit)
  - Access rights (readable, writable, executable, privilege level)
  - Type information (code, data, system segments)
- **Ghidra's Hack**: Ignores all descriptor information beyond a synthetic base address
- **Impact**: Analysis cannot understand segment boundaries, access restrictions, or privilege levels

#### 3. **Descriptor Table Lookup Bypass**
- **Reality**: Every memory access requires descriptor validation and limit checking
- **Ghidra's Hack**: Direct arithmetic calculation bypasses all protection mechanisms
- **Impact**: Cannot detect segment limit violations or access right violations that would cause exceptions

#### 4. **Privilege Level Ignorance**
- **Reality**: Selectors encode Current Privilege Level (CPL) and Descriptor Privilege Level (DPL)
- **Ghidra's Hack**: Treats all selectors equally regardless of privilege bits
- **Impact**: Cannot analyze privilege transitions, system calls, or protection violations

#### 5. **Binary Compatibility Constraints**
- **Works With**: Binaries that can function under Ghidra's specific segment allocation scheme
- **Fails With**: 
  - Binaries that depend on specific descriptor table layouts
  - Code that performs descriptor table manipulation
  - Programs that rely on segment limit checking
  - Multi-privilege level operating systems

### Why This Approach?

#### Implementation Complexity
Proper 16-bit protected mode support would require:
- **Descriptor Table Emulation**: Full GDT/LDT tracking and parsing
- **Segment Register State**: Complex state management for descriptor caches
- **Memory Protection Logic**: Limit checking and access right validation
- **Privilege Level Tracking**: CPL/DPL comparison for every memory access
- **Exception Handling**: Proper modeling of protection faults

#### Architectural Constraints
- **SLEIGH Limitations**: Processor specification language lacks descriptor table lookup capabilities
- **Analysis Framework**: Ghidra's analysis engine expects relatively static address spaces
- **Performance Impact**: Full protection checking would significantly slow analysis

### Practical Implications

#### What Works
- **Simple Protected Mode Programs**: Basic applications that don't exploit advanced protection features
- **Flat Memory Model**: Programs that use large segments covering the entire address space
- **Single Privilege Level**: Applications running at a consistent privilege level

#### What Doesn't Work
- **Operating System Kernels**: Heavy reliance on privilege transitions and descriptor manipulation
- **Real-Time Systems**: Precise segment limit checking for memory protection
- **Legacy DOS Extenders**: Complex segment management and descriptor table manipulation
- **Multi-Tasking Systems**: Per-task descriptor table and segment state management

### Recommended Usage
- **Primary Focus**: Use Ghidra for **real mode** analysis where this implementation provides full architectural accuracy
- **Protected Mode**: Accept the limitations and use for basic analysis of simple protected mode binaries
- **Advanced Analysis**: Consider specialized tools for operating systems or complex protected mode software

### Future Considerations
Implementing true 16-bit protected mode support would require:
1. **Major Framework Changes**: Core address space and memory management modifications
2. **SLEIGH Extensions**: New language features for descriptor table operations  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient caching of descriptor table state
4. **UI Enhancements**: Visualization of segment descriptors and protection information

For now, the focus remains on providing excellent **real mode segmentation support** while acknowledging the protected mode limitations as an acceptable trade-off for implementation complexity.
